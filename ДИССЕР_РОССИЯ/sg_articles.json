        "full_content": "US President Donald Trump (left) did not appear to secure major concessions from Russian President Vladimir Putin during a two-hour phone call. PHOTO: REUTERS, AFP\n\n– US President Donald Trump spoke with President Vladimir Putin on May 19 and said Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations towards a ceasefire, but the Kremlin said reaching an agreement would take time and Mr Trump indicated he was not ready to join Europe with fresh sanctions to pressure Moscow.\n\nIn a social media post, Mr Trump said he relayed the plan to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as well as the leaders of the European Union, France, Italy, Germany and Finland in a group call following his session with Mr Putin.\n\n“Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations towards a ceasefire and, more importantly, an end to the war,” Mr Trump said, adding later at the White House that he thought “some progress is being made”.\n\nEuropean leaders decided to increase pressure on Russia through sanctions after Mr Trump briefed them on his call with Mr Putin, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in a post on social media platform X late on May 19 .\n\nMr Trump did not appear ready to follow that move.\n\nWhen asked why he had not imposed fresh sanctions to push Moscow into a peace deal as he has threatened, Mr Trump told reporters: “Well because I think there’s a chance of getting something done, and if you do that, you can also make it much worse. But there could be a time where that’s going to happen.”\n\nMr Trump said there were “some big egos involved”.\n\nWithout progress, “I’m just going to back away”, he said, repeating a warning that he could abandon the process.\n\n“This is not my war.”\n\nAfter speaking to Mr Trump, Mr Putin said efforts to end the war were “generally on the right track” and that Moscow was ready to work with Ukraine on a potential peace deal.\n\n“We have agreed with the President of the United States that Russia will propose and is ready to work with the Ukrainian side on a memorandum on a possible future peace accord,” he told reporters near the Black Sea resort of Sochi.\n\nEuropean leaders and Ukraine have demanded Russia agree to a ceasefire immediately, and Mr Trump has focused on getting Mr Putin to commit to a 30-day truce. The Russian leader has resisted that, insisting that conditions be met first.\n\nKremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said Mr Trump and Mr Putin did not discuss a timeline for a ceasefire but did discuss trading nine Russians for nine Americans in a prisoner swop. He said the US leader called prospects for ties between Moscow and Washington “impressive”.\n\nRussian state news agencies cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Moscow and Kyiv faced “complex contacts” to develop a unified text of a peace and ceasefire memorandum.\n\n“There are no deadlines and there cannot be any. It is clear that everyone wants to do this as quickly as possible, but, of course, the devil is in the details,” the RIA agency quoted him as saying.\n\nFormer Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt said on X that the call with Mr Trump was “undoubtedly a win for Putin”.\n\nThe Russian leader “deflected the call for an… immediate ceasefire and instead can continue military operations at the same time as he puts pressure on at the negotiating table”.\n\nHigh-level meeting\n\nAfter speaking with Mr Trump, Mr Zelensky said Kyiv and its partners might seek a high-level meeting among Ukraine, Russia, the US, European Union countries and Britain as part of a push to end the war.\n\nHe said he hoped this could happen soon and be hosted by Turkey, the Vatican or Switzerland. It was not immediately clear if this would be part of the negotiations Mr Trump said would start immediately.\n\nMr Trump said Pope Leo had expressed interest in hosting the negotiations at the Vatican. The Vatican did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOne person familiar with Mr Trump’s call with the Ukrainian and European leaders said participants were “shocked” that the US leader did not want to push Mr Putin with sanctions.\n\nIn a post on X, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the conversation with Mr Trump was “good” and it was “important that the US stays engaged”.\n\nUkraine and its supporters have accused Russia of failing to negotiate in good faith, doing the minimum needed to keep Mr Trump from applying new pressure on its economy.\n\nProdded by Mr Trump, delegates from the warring countries met last week in Istanbul for the first time since 2022, in the early months of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but those talks failed to produce a truce.\n\nProspects for progress dimmed after Mr Putin spurned Mr Zelensky’s proposal they meet face to face in Istanbul, and Mr Trump said there would be no movement unless he and Mr Putin met.\n\nMr Putin, whose forces control a fifth of Ukraine and are advancing, has stood firm on his conditions for ending the war.\n\nHe said the memorandum Russia and Ukraine would work on about a future peace accord would define “a number of positions, such as, for example, the principles of settlement, the timing of a possible peace agreement”.\n\nMr Putin said: “The main thing for us is to eliminate the root causes of this crisis.\n\n“We just need to determine the most effective ways to move towards peace.” REUTERS\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you."

PHOTO: ST FILE\n\nS’pore-based TikToker gets 11½ years’ jail and caning for raping woman he met on Tinder\n\nSINGAPORE - A TikToker and former scriptwriter-actor with local YouTube comedy channel Wah!Banana was sentenced to 11½ years’ jail and 12 strokes of the cane on May 19 for raping a woman he had met on the dating app Tinder.\n\nLev Panfilov, a 29-year-old Singapore permanent resident originally from Russia, was earlier found guilty by the High Court of two counts of rape, one count of sexual assault by penetration, and one count of outrage of modesty.\n\nThe assault took place on Jan 12, 2021, in Panfilov’s bedroom after he invited the woman back to the flat he shared with flatmates to work on her script.\n\nThe woman, who was then 30 years old, had worked as an actress and model and was trying to branch out into comedy writing.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Sheldon Lim sought 14 years’ jail and 16 strokes of the cane.\n\nIn written submissions, the prosecution said Panfilov lacked remorse, as he had prolonged his trial unnecessarily by subjecting the woman to a marathon 13 days of cross-examination.\n\nThe prosecution noted that Panfilov had tried to leave Singapore midway through the trial, without any permission being granted by the court.\n\nOn Dec 9, 2023, he was stopped at the entrance to the departure hall of Changi Airport Terminal 1, as he was trying to use his new Russian passport to pass through to board his flight .\n\nAs a result, Panfilov, who was on bail up to that point, was arrested and remanded in custody. He had applied for and obtained the new passport without the knowledge of the investigating officer.\n\nLawyer Sameer Melber who, together with Mr Manoj Nandwani , now acts for Panfilov, asked for 10 years and five months’ jail and six strokes of the cane.\n\nMr Sameer said the sequence of events shows there was no element of premeditation on the part of his client, and that the woman had ended up in Panfilov’s bed of her own volition.\n\nThe lawyer said his client intends to get married later in 2025 and also pursue his education in prison.\n\nDuring the trial, which began in May 2023, the woman and Panfilov presented different accounts of the incident.\n\nThe two had matched on Tinder and later moved their chat to WhatsApp before arranging to meet in person at a restaurant in Robertson Quay.\n\nShe testified that his Tinder profile had stated he was either a writer or scriptwriter, and that she had hoped to get some advice on scriptwriting from him.\n\nAt the restaurant, she opened her laptop and started working on her script with him.\n\nShe said that after waiters came round to ask if they had any last orders, Panfilov suggested continuing working on the script at his place, and she agreed.\n\nThe two went to the flat separately – Panfilov rode his motorcycle and the woman took a Grab car.\n\nAt his flat, he ushered her into his bedroom. They sat on his bed as they talked about comedic characters and watched videos of various comedians. She said she sat on his bed because the room was otherwise rather cluttered.\n\nThe woman said he suddenly leaned in and kissed her on her lips, but she told him “no” and gathered her things to leave.\n\nBut he sexually assaulted her and raped her on his bed, she said.\n\nOn Jan 16, 2021, still in pain from the assault, she saw a doctor, who advised her to make a police report.\n\nThe same day, she went to a neighbourhood police centre and spoke to several police officers but left without lodging a report.\n\nAround midnight on Jan 18, 2021, she finally told her mother what had happened. Her mother took her to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital, and a police report was lodged.\n\nPanfilov did not deny that he had sex with the woman but said the encounter was consensual. He said she had made the first advances – laughing at his jokes, tapping on his leg and stroking his thigh.\n\nAfter they had sex, he asked for her address and booked a car on the Gojek app for her to get home.\n\nHe said he later messaged her, asking if she had reached home safely, and she replied that all was good.\n\nHe said he subsequently did not reply to her because her interest in morbid jokes was not in line with his sense of humour.\n\nOn March 21, Justice Pang Khang Chau found the woman to be an unusually convincing witness who gave a detailed and textured account that was internally and externally consistent. The judge accepted that she had explanations for the issues raised by the defence.\n\nOn the other hand, Justice Pang found that Panfilov was not a credible witness and that his testimony did not help in casting reasonable doubts on the prosecution’s case.\n\nThe judge said there were significant inconsistencies between what Panfilov said to police officers, what he said in his video-recorded interviews and what he said in court.\n\nPanfilov will be appealing against his conviction and sentence.\n\nJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads."

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nZelensky says Ukraine will observe Putin’s Easter truce, but accuses Russia of breaches\n\nKYIV - Ukraine will abide by an Easter truce, President Volodymyr Zelensky said, hours after Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops to pause all combat activity until 2100 GMT on April 20 (5am on April 21 in Singapore).\n\nThe 30-hour truce would be the most significant pause in the fighting throughout the three-year conflict.\n\nBut just hours after the order was meant to have come into effect, air-raid sirens sounded in the Ukrainian capital and Mr Zelensky accused Russia of having maintained its artillery fire and assaults on the frontline.\n\nAlso on April 19, Russia and Ukraine held a large exchange of prisoners, with each side saying it had handed back more than 240 captured fighters.\n\nThe order to halt all combat over the Easter weekend came after months of efforts by US President Donald Trump to get Moscow and Kyiv to agree a ceasefire. On Friday, Washington even threatened to withdraw from talks if no progress was made.\n\nMr Putin announced the Easter truce in televised comments during a meeting with the Russian chief of the general staff Valery Gerasimov.\n\nMr Zelensky responded by saying Ukraine would follow suit, and proposed extending the truce beyond April 20. But the Ukrainian leader also accused Russia of having already broken its promises.\n\n“If Russia is now suddenly ready to truly engage in a format of full and unconditional silence, Ukraine will act accordingly – mirroring Russia’s actions,” Mr Zelensky said on April 19, in a post on X.\n\n“Russian assault operations continue on several front-line sectors, and Russian artillery fire has not subsided,” he said.\n\nUkraine’s Kherson governor reported several Russian drone attacks after Mr Putin’s order was supposed to have come into force at 6pm.\n\n‘Give peace a chance’\n\nUkraine’s air force issued air-raid warnings across several regions in eastern Ukraine on April 19 evening, also while the ceasefire was supposed to be in effect.\n\nUkraine’s air force said on social media there was a “ballistic missile threat” and official air-raid maps indicated alerts issued for the Kharkiv, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk regions.\n\n“Therefore, there is no trust in words coming from Moscow,” Mr Zelensky said.\n\n“We know all too well how Moscow manipulates, and we are prepared for anything. Ukraine’s Defence Forces will act rationally – responding in kind. Every Russian strike will be met with an appropriate response,” he added.\n\nMr Putin had said the truce for the Easter holiday celebrated on April 20 was motivated by “humanitarian reasons”.\n\nWhile he expected Ukraine to comply, he said that Russian troops “must be ready to resist possible breaches of the truce and provocations by the enemy”.\n\nMr Zelensky in a social media post wrote: “If Russia is now suddenly ready to truly engage in a format of full and unconditional silence, Ukraine will act accordingly – mirroring Russia’s actions.”\n\nHe added: “If a complete ceasefire truly takes hold, Ukraine proposes extending it beyond the Easter day of April 20.”\n\nHe proposed that “30 days could give peace a chance”, while pointing out that Mr Putin had earlier rejected a proposed 30-day full and unconditional ceasefire.\n\nUkraine had accepted that offer.\n\nMr Trump is pushing to end the three-year war, but on April 18 threatened to ditch his efforts to broker a ceasefire if he did not see meaningful progress soon.\n\nAttacks continue\n\n“The fighting is ongoing, and Russian attacks continue,” Ukraine’s military command, the Chief of Staff, reported April 19 evening.\n\n“In some areas on the frontline, Russian artillery continues to be heard, despite the promise of silence from the Russian leader. Russian drones are being used. It is quieter in some areas.”\n\nSoldiers in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk close to the front line earlier greeted the truce announcement with scepticism.\n\nMr Putin “might do it to give some hope or to show his humanity”, said Dmitry, a 40-year-old soldier. “But either way, of course, we don’t trust (Russia).”\n\nMr Putin said the latest truce proposal would show “how sincere is the Kyiv’s regime’s readiness, its desire and ability to observe agreements and participate in a process of peace talks”.\n\nRussia launched its full-scale invasion of neighbouring Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nPrevious attempts at holding ceasefires for Easter in April 2022 and Orthodox Christmas in January 2023 were not implemented after both sides failed to agree on them.\n\nCaptives swopped\n\n“For millions of Ukrainians, Easter is one of the most important holidays. And millions of Ukrainians will go to church,” said Mr Zelensky in his evening address.\n\n“Over the years of this full-scale war, Russian attacks have destroyed or damaged more than 600 churches, prayer houses and places of worship.”\n\nIn Kramatorsk, one soldier Vladislav, 22, said: “I feel like it’s going to start again after a while, and it’s going to go on and on.”\n\nOn the streets of Moscow, Mr Yevgeny Pavlov, 58, said he did not think Russia should give Ukraine a breather.\n\n“There is no need to give them respite. If we press, it means we should press to the end,” he told AFP.\n\nEarlier on April 19, Ukraine and Russia said they had each returned 246 soldiers being held as prisoners of war in a swop mediated by the United Arab Emirates.\n\nMr Zelensky said the total number of returned POWs now stood at 4,552.\n\nThe UAE’s foreign ministry said 31 wounded Ukrainians and 15 wounded Russians were also exchanged.\n\nThe UAE said it was committed to “finding a peaceful solution” to the conflict and “mitigating the humanitarian impacts”.\n\nRussia said it had retaken the penultimate village still under Ukrainian control in its Kursk frontier region.\n\nKyiv had hoped to use its hold on the region as a bargaining chip in the talks.

Timothy Haugh, who headed both the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command until Thursday — when he was let go without a single reason divulged to voters.\n\n“The White House fired one of our best generals and the smartest on cyber operations, and with no explanation,” Bacon told Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram on Friday. “Russia and China are laughing at us.”\n\nChief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement Friday to CBS News that the “Defense Department thanks General Timothy Haugh for his decades of service” and that the DoD wishes “him and his family well” — providing no further detail about his exit.\n\nSeveral senior members of the National Security Council were also fired.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHaugh and NSA deputy Wendy Noble were both ousted after Trump met with far-right activist Laura Loomer on Wednesday, The Washington Post reported. Loomer, who has frequently shared QAnon conspiracy theories and is one of Trump’s staunchest social media supporters, told the Post she had advocated for the firings.\n\nLoomer elaborated on the matter Friday on X, formerly Twitter, arguing that Haugh and Noble “have been disloyal to President Trump” and “that is why they have been fired.”\n\nShe also slammed retired Gen. Mark Milley, who called Trump “a total fascist” in October.\n\n“As a Biden appointee, General Haugh had no place serving in the Trump admin given the fact that he was HAND PICKED by General Milley, who was accused of committing treason by President Trump,” she wrote.\n\n“Given the fact that the NSA is arguably the most powerful intel agency in the world, we cannot allow for a Biden nominee to hold that position,” she added. “Thus, Haugh was fired today, along with his Obama loving protege, Wendy Noble. This is called VETTING.”\n\nBacon previously criticized Trump's foreign policy position on Russia as \"too conciliatory.\" Left: Alex Brandon/Associated Press; Right: Associated Press\n\nLoomer gave Trump a list of supposedly disloyal officials during their closed-door meeting Wednesday, and successfully called for them to be fired despite national security adviser Michael Waltz reportedly pushing back, The New York Times reported Thursday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe report was based on interviews with eight people with knowledge of the events.\n\nBacon, who previously criticized Trump for berating Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during their televised meeting in February and called Trump’s stance on Russia “too conciliatory,” shared an additional statement on Haugh’s exit Friday on X.\n\n“General Tim Haugh is an outstanding leader and was doing a superb job at Cyber Command and National Security Agency,” he wrote. “He was fired with no public explanation. This action sets back our Cyber and Signals Intelligence operations.”\n\nRelated..."

        "full_content": "US and Ukrainian officials posing for a picture after their meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nJEDDAH, Saudi Arabia – The United States agreed on March 11 to resume military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine after talks where Kyiv said it would accept a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in its conflict with Russia, the countries said in a joint statement.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US would now take the offer to Russia, and that the ball is in Moscow’s court.\n\n“The President wanted this war to end yesterday... So our hope is that the Russians will answer ‘yes’ as quickly as possible, so we can get to the second phase of this, which is real negotiations,” Mr Rubio told reporters, referring to US President Donald Trump, after more than eight hours of talks in Jeddah.\n\nThe Kremlin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago, and Russia, which has been making advances, now holds around a fifth of Ukraine’s territory, including Crimea, which it claims to have annexed in 2014.\n\nMr Rubio said Washington wanted a full agreement with both Russia and Ukraine “as soon as possible”.\n\n“Every day that goes by, this war continues, people die, people are bombed, people are hurt on both sides of this conflict,” he said.\n\nHow Moscow would respond was far from certain.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said he is open to discussing a peace deal. But he has ruled out territorial concessions, and has said Ukraine must withdraw fully from four Ukrainian regions claimed and partly controlled by Russia.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was in Saudi Arabia but did not participate in the talks, said the ceasefire was a “positive proposal” that covers the front line in the conflict, not just fighting by air and sea.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, the US and Ukraine also said they agreed to conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine’s critical mineral resources, a deal that has been in the works for weeks and was thrown into limbo by an acrimonious White House meeting between the Republican US president and Mr Zelensky last week.\n\nA top aide to Mr Zelensky said options for security guarantees to Ukraine were discussed with US officials. The aide did not detail the options. Security guarantees have been one of Kyiv’s key aims, and some European countries have expressed willingness to explore sending peacekeepers.\n\nMr Rubio said the plan will be delivered to the Russians through multiple channels. Mr Trump’s national security adviser, Mr Mike Waltz, told reporters that he would be talking to his Russian counterpart in the coming days.\n\nIn the joint statement, Ukraine reiterated that European partners should be involved in the peace process.

This was approved by former US president Joe Biden, using so-called Presidential Drawdown Authority, before he left office, and stopped by Mr Trump after the acrimonious White House meeting.\n\nAs the diplomacy plays out, Ukraine’s battlefield positions have been under heavy pressure, particularly in Russia’s Kursk region where Moscow’s forces have launched a push to flush out Kyiv’s troops, which had been trying to hold a patch of land as a bargaining chip.\n\nUkraine overnight launched its biggest drone attack on Moscow and the surrounding region yet, showing that Kyiv can also land major blows after a steady stream of Russian missile and drone attacks, one of which killed 14 people on March 8.\n\nThe attack, in which 337 drones were downed over Russia, killed at least three employees of a meat warehouse and caused a short shutdown at Moscow’s four airports, Russian officials said.\n\nUkraine said its drones struck an oil refinery near Moscow and a facility in Russia’s Oryol region, while Hungary said crude oil shipments via Russia’s Druzhba pipeline were suspended following the attack.\n\nUS and Russian officials met in the Saudi capital in February in a rare encounter between the former Cold War foes.

PHOTO: AFP\n\nSEOUL – Upcoming joint drills by US and South Korean forces will factor in North Korea’s deepening military ties with Russia, according to a statement from Seoul, underscoring growing concerns about that alliance as tensions rise globally.\n\nThe Exercise Freedom Shield 25 combined drills will run from March 10 to March 20, with joint field training that will involve various units, from land to cyberspace, said South Korea’s Defence Ministry in a statement.\n\nThe drills will help reinforce confidence that the US-South Korea alliance remains firm despite a leadership crisis in Seoul after President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached for his brief attempt to impose martial law in December 2024.\n\nThe joint drills will be the first since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, and they come at a time when North Korea has threatened to beef up its nuclear deterrence against what it labels provocations by Washington and Seoul.\n\n“By reflecting realistic threats, lessons learnt from recent armed conflicts, and evolving challenges, including the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s military strategy, tactics and capabilities, as well as its growing partnership with Russia, the ROK-US alliance will further strengthen its readiness, capability and combined defence posture,” the statement added, referring to the South’s official name, Republic of Korea.\n\nIn recent months, North Korea has supplied artillery shells and sent troops to Russia to take part in the war in Ukraine, triggering condemnation from South Korea and the US.\n\nThe statement from South Korea did not say how exactly the Pyongyang-Moscow ties will be incorporated into the drills with the US.\n\nSouth Korea relies on security guarantees from the US to deter North Korean aggression, providing sites that host about 28,500 American troops.\n\nEarlier in March, a nuclear-powered US aircraft carrier docked at a South Korean port, prompting the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to denounce the deployment of strategic assets in the region.\n\nIn her statement on March 4, Ms Kim Yo Jong did not say whether she meant Pyongyang would conduct more nuclear or missile tests in response to what she characterised as US hostility.\n\nThe US and South Korea say their exercises are intended to enhance combat readiness and capabilities, and are not aimed at toppling the regime in Pyongyang.\n\nNorth Korea’s last nuclear test took place in 2017, but it routinely conducts missile launches.\n\nDuring his first term, Mr Trump announced the suspension or scaling down of some major US-South Korea military drills, making the decision after his 2018 Singapore Summit with Mr Kim.\n\nThe two met again in Vietnam in 2019 without reaching a deal to disarm North Korea of its nuclear arms.

PHOTO: AFP\n\n– US President Donald Trump called Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky a “dictator” on Feb 19, widening a personal rift with major implications for efforts to end the conflict triggered by Russia’s invasion three years ago.\n\nThe US had provided funding and arms to Ukraine, but in an abrupt policy shift since coming to power, Mr Trump has opened talks with Moscow.\n\n“A dictator without elections, Zelensky better move fast, or he is not going to have a country left,” Mr Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform of the Ukrainian leader, whose five-year term expired in 2024.\n\nMartial law introduced following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 bans a wartime election.\n\nThe Constitution says the president serves until a newly elected one takes office.\n\nMr Trump’s comments have spurred some, though not all of Ukraine’s opposition figures to speak out and rally around Mr Zelensky despite seeing him as a political opponent.\n\nFormer prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko said Mr Zelensky was Ukraine’s legitimate leader until someone else was elected and that it was “impossible and immoral” to hold elections during the war, as the military would not be able to take part.\n\nShe said on Facebook: “Only Ukrainians have the right to decide when and under what conditions they should change their government. Today, there are no such conditions!”\n\nOn Feb 19, Mr Trump said his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was treated “rudely” during an official visit to Kyiv. He also accused Mr Zelensky of “sleeping” and failing to make a deal.\n\nMr Bessent was dispatched to Kyiv on Feb 12 to discuss with Mr Zelensky granting Washington access to rare earth minerals in return for security support.\n\n“Scott Bessent actually went there and was treated rather rudely, because essentially, they told him ‘no’,” Mr Trump told reporters on Air Force One.\n\n“And Zelensky was sleeping and unavailable to meet him.”\n\nMr Bessent “travelled many hours on the train, which is a dangerous trip, and we’re talking about the Secretary of the Treasury”, Mr Trump said.\n\n“He went there to get a document signed, and when he got there, he came back empty,” he added.\n\n“They wouldn’t sign the document.”\n\nMr Bessent said Mr Zelensky assured him ahead of the Munich Security Conference that took place between Feb 14 and Feb 16 that Ukraine would sign a US$500 billion (S$668.6 billion) deal handing over rights to Ukrainian minerals but has not signed yet.\n\nOn Feb 18, Mr Trump held a press conference in which he criticised Mr Zelensky, repeated several Kremlin narratives about the conflict and called for an end to the war.\n\nMr Zelensky in turn accused Mr Trump of succumbing to Russian “disinformation” – including the US President blaming Kyiv for having “started” the war and echoing Kremlin questions over the Ukrainian leader’s legitimacy.\n\n“He refuses to have elections, is very low in Ukrainian polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing (former US president Joe) Biden ‘like a fiddle’,” Mr Trump said in his Truth Social post of Mr Zelensky.\n\n“In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the war with Russia, something all admit only ‘ Trump ’, and the Trump administration, can do,” he added.\n\nMr Trump said he hoped for a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine soon.\n\nMr Zelensky was elected in 2019 for a five-year term but has remained leader under martial law imposed following the Russian invasion.\n\nHis popularity has eroded, but the percentage of Ukrainians who trust him has never dipped below 50 per cent since the conflict started, according to the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.\n\nMr Trump’s invective drew shock from Europe, where German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it was “wrong and dangerous” to call Mr Zelensky a dictator.\n\n‘Doublethink’\n\nMr Trump has long held his party in lockstep, but moderate Republicans swiftly pushed back against his attack on Mr Zelensky.\n\n“(Russian President Vladimir) Putin started this war. Putin committed war crimes. Putin is the dictator who murdered his opponents. The EU nations have contributed more to Ukraine. Zelensky polls over 50 per cent. Ukraine wants to be part of the West, Putin hates the West,” Representative Don Bacon, from Nebraska, wrote on social media platform X on Feb 19.\n\n“I don’t accept George Orwell’s doublethink,” he added, referring to the author of the dystopian novel 1984.\n\nUnder Mr Biden, the US lauded Mr Zelensky as a hero and hammered Moscow with sanctions as Ukraine battled against advancing Russian troops.\n\nNew York Republican Mike Lawler said Mr Putin demanding an election in Ukraine was “both comical and self-serving”.\n\nHe said on X: “Vladimir Putin is a vile dictator and thug, who has worked in a concerted effort with China and Iran to undermine and destabilise the United States, Europe, Israel and the free world. He is not our friend, nor our ally.”\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Mr Trump’s staunch ally, meanwhile, threaded the needle carefully, writing that he blames Mr Putin “above all others” for the war – but adding on X that he still saw the US President as Ukraine’s “best hope”.\n\nFormer vice-president Mike Pence, who broke with Mr Trump after his supporters stormed the US Capitol in 2021 in a bid to overturn his 2020 election loss to Mr Biden, also issued a rare public rebuke.\n\n“Mr President, Ukraine did not ‘start’ this war. Russia launched an unprovoked and brutal invasion, claiming hundreds of thousands of lives,” he wrote on X.\n\nMoscow buoyed\n\nMoscow has been buoyed by US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb 18 on ending the war in Ukraine and Mr Trump’s attacks on Mr Zelensky.\n\nThe talks “made the first step to restore work in various areas of mutual interests”, Mr Putin told journalists while visiting a drone manufacturing plant in his native St Petersburg.\n\nKyiv was not invited to the Riyadh talks, as Moscow and Washington moved to sideline both Ukraine and Europe.\n\nMr Putin said the US allies “only have themselves to blame for what’s happening”, suggesting they were paying the price for opposing Mr Trump’s return to the White House.\n\nTensions between Mr Zelensky and Mr Trump over the new US position on the war had been building for weeks, before bursting into the open.\n\nBut Mr Zelensky sought to take a positive approach ahead of meeting Mr Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, Mr Keith Kellogg, in Kyiv on Feb 20, saying that “it is very important for us that the meeting and our work with America in general be constructive”.\n\nAfter their meeting, Mr Zelensky’s office said their joint news conference was cancelled at the request of the US, the RBC-Ukraine outlet reported.\n\nRussia, which for years has railed against the US military presence in Europe, wants a reorganisation of the continent’s security framework as part of any deal to end the Ukraine fighting.\n\nMr Putin on Feb 19 said Russia and the US needed to work with each other if talks were to be successful.\n\n“It is impossible to solve many issues, including the Ukrainian crisis, without increasing the level of trust between Russia and the United States,” he said.

PHOTO: AFP\n\nNews analysis US seems more than happy to satisfy Russia’s aspirations at talks in Saudi Arabia\n\n– Russia emerged as the clear winner from talks held between US and Russian officials in the Saudi capital of Riyadh on Feb 18.\n\nThe first public diplomatic encounter between the two powers in three years was convened to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nBut in Riyadh, the American delegation – composed of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Mr Steve Witkoff, the US President’s special envoy and golf buddy – dangled before the Russians the much broader prospect of productive cooperation in geopolitics and, above all, economic investments.\n\nTherefore, it was hardly surprising that the usually glum-looking Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who has led his country’s diplomacy for more than two decades, was beaming broadly at the end of the talks in Saudi Arabia.\n\nMr Lavrov said that “the atmosphere was exceedingly positive” and referred to the US negotiators as “positive individuals”.\n\nUS President Donald Trump agreed to negotiations over the war in Ukraine after a Feb 12 phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis generated a storm of protests from European governments, who were not consulted before the launch of Mr Trump’s initiative and argued that no settlement of the Ukraine conflict was feasible without Ukrainians sitting at the negotiation table.\n\nAmerican officials dismissed such concerns as premature and exaggerated.\n\nThey said that the talks in Riyadh were preliminary, just feelers to determine the Russian position.\n\nBut right from the start, Moscow was careful to present its renewed links with the US as more than just a discussion over Ukraine.\n\n“The main thing is to begin a real normalisation of relations between us and Washington,” said Mr Yuri Ushakov, a former Russian ambassador to the US and one of Mr Putin’s closest foreign policy aides, who also attended the talks in Riyadh.\n\nThere are two reasons why the Russians are eager to cast their talks with the US in a broader perspective.\n\nThe first is that the Russians have already obtained the main concessions on Ukraine they wanted from the US.\n\nEven before the Riyadh talks started, Mr Trump announced that he sought an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine almost regardless of the conditions, that Russia would be allowed to keep the estimated 20 per cent of Ukraine’s territory it currently occupies, and that Ukraine would not benefit from any future US security guarantees.\n\nRussia’s diplomats were initially expected to fight hard for such concessions.\n\nInstead, they received them on a plate, and the Russians now want more.\n\nThe second explanation for Russia’s growing aspirations is that Mr Putin has long sought to recover his country’s status as a global power.\n\nTherefore, any agreement with the US that boosts Russia in this direction is welcome.\n\nIn Riyadh, the US negotiators seemed more than happy to satisfy Russia’s aspirations.\n\nThey agreed, for instance, that one of the two countries’ priorities is to remove the restrictions placed on each other’s diplomatic missions.\n\nThese restrictions started in March 2018 when none other than Mr Trump was in the White House and when the US, together with its allies, expelled a large number of Russian diplomats in response to a botched attempt by Mr Putin’s agents to poison Russian defectors living in the English city of Salisbury.\n\nSince then, Russia and the US have imposed caps on embassies in each other’s capitals and have closed several consulates.\n\nIn Riyadh, however, Russian and US negotiators agreed to “establish a consultation mechanism to address irritants” in their bilateral relationship “with the objective of taking steps necessary to normalise the operation of our respective diplomatic missions”, according to the official communique.\n\nMore importantly, Mr Rubio stated that the two sides laid “the groundwork for future cooperation on matters of mutual geopolitical interest and historic economic and investment opportunities”.\n\nAll of this is music to Moscow’s ears, so Russia responded almost immediately by tightening its demands on Ukraine.\n\nSoon after the talks in Riyadh concluded, Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova raised what appeared to be a new condition: Russia was demanding “not just a pledge” to deny Ukraine any future Western security guarantees, but a formal withdrawal of previous plans to admit Ukraine into the Nato military alliance.\n\nAnd Mr Lavrov upped the stakes even further by specifying that Russia will not accept the presence of any Western troops on Ukraine’s soil under any guise.\n\n“The deployment of troops from the same Nato countries, but under a different flag – European Union or their national flags – changes nothing. Of course, this is unacceptable for us,” Mr Lavrov said.\n\nSuch preconditions amount to an apparent demand that Ukraine should be abandoned to Russia’s mercies.\n\nTo make matters worse, Mr Trump subsequently appeared to accept Russia’s propaganda narrative about Ukraine.\n\nIn a press conference soon after the Riyadh talks concluded, Mr Trump falsely claimed that Ukraine, rather than Russia, started the current war, which began in February 2022.\n\n“You should have never started it,” the US President said, pretending to address Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nMr Trump also called for fresh elections in Ukraine, claiming – yet again, falsely – that Mr Zelensky’s domestic popularity is “down at 4 per cent approval rating”.\n\nThis is a Russian claim that the US President also appears to share, notwithstanding the latest opinion polls inside Ukraine, which indicate that Mr Zelensky’s popularity stands at 50 per cent.\n\nEuropean governments are alarmed by rumours that Mr Trump is even prepared to discuss a withdrawal of some American troops from Europe in return for a broader deal with Russia.\n\nUS officials scrambled to reassure their European allies as the Riyadh talks ended.\n\nThe allies “are consulted literally almost every day”, said Mr Waltz.\n\nAnd Mr Rubio phoned key European foreign ministers to brief them about the talks with Russia.\n\nHowever, Europeans are not reassured.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron’s call for another summit of European leaders on Feb 19 – the second such gathering this week – indicates their alarm.\n\n“Russia will try to divide us. Let’s not walk into their traps. By working together with the US, we can achieve a just and lasting peace – on Ukraine’s terms,” urged Ms Kaja Kallas, the EU’s top diplomat.\n\nFew believe that Washington is listening to her appeal.\n\nJonathan Eyal is based in London and Brussels and writes on global political and security issues.\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you."

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\n- When Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago, then US president Joe Biden took a firm stand in solidarity with Kyiv, forged a bulwark of European allies and set veteran advisers to the task of isolating Moscow economically and diplomatically.\n\nWashington’s approach changed dramatically with a Feb 18 initial meeting between US and Russian negotiators.\n\nThe officials met just a month after Mr Donald Trump returned to the White House, with Ukraine and Nato partners sidelined by a relatively inexperienced team of Trump aides, and Mr Putin granted concessions even before the talks got under way.\n\nMr Trump’s rush to impose an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine has stoked fears of a peace deal with Mr Putin that could undermine Kyiv and Europe’s security and alter the geopolitical landscape.\n\n“The really worrying fact is that Trump has taken Russia from pariah to prize partner in the time span of just a few days. That comes at a price,” said Mr Brett Bruen, a former foreign policy adviser in the Obama administration.\n\nThe talks in Riyadh, the first time the US and Russia have met to discuss the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II, yielded agreement to form negotiating teams for future meetings and work to restore the normal functioning of each other’s diplomatic missions, reflecting a thawing of long-frozen relations.\n\nEven before the talks, European politicians accused Mr Trump of handing free concessions to Moscow last week by ruling out Nato membership for Ukraine and saying it was an illusion for Kyiv to believe it could win back the 20 per cent of its territory now under Russian control. Some critics condemned Mr Trump for what they said amounted to appeasement.\n\nMajor players excluded\n\nUkraine’s exclusion from the meeting on Feb 18 marked a sharp departure from Mr Biden and Nato’s mantra of “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine”. Kyiv has said it will not accept any deal imposed without its consent.\n\nAnd the absence of European representatives added to US allies’ anxieties about whether Mr Trump might be willing to give up too much for little from Mr Putin.\n\nThat helped spur European governments to discuss the possibility of contributing peacekeepers to back any deal on Ukraine.\n\nMr Trump told reporters on Feb 18 he would not object to such a deployment, though Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow would not accept Nato troops there, signaling that Russia may resist any major compromise.\n\nThere was no immediate sign that Russian officials had offered any concessions in the meeting.\n\nThe encounter saw Mr Lavrov and Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov – two veterans who have spent a combined 34 years in their current roles – negotiate with three Trump aides in their first month on the job – Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Trump envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\n“The American team has almost no experience in high-level international negotiation, no regional expertise on Ukraine and Russia, and no relevant foreign language knowledge,” Dr Timothy Snyder, a Yale University professor and Russia expert, wrote on X. “Not true of the Russians, to put it mildly.”\n\nMr Bruen described it as “amateur hour” for Mr Trump’s national security apparatus.\n\nA Trump administration official said Washington could not help foster a lasting peace with the same lack of engagement that has allowed the death and destruction in Ukraine to continue.\n\n“President Trump has built a strong team that is already demonstrating his peace through strength agenda in action,” said Mr Brian Hughes, spokesman for the White House National Security Council.\n\nMr Trump said he was more confident after the talks and he would probably meet with Mr Putin before the end of the month. He has praised Mr Putin in the past and commended him for a conciliatory attitude after their phone call last week.\n\n“Russia wants to do something,” Mr Trump told reporters in Palm Beach, Florida, on Feb 18 . He brushed aside Ukraine’s concern about being left out of the meeting and said Kyiv should have entered talks much earlier.\n\nMr Rubio said earlier that no one was being frozen out and any solution must be acceptable to all parties. But there was no immediate word on how Ukraine might be allowed to join.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky postponed a visit to Saudi Arabia planned for Feb 19 because of what sources familiar with the matter said was to avoid giving “legitimacy” to the US-Russia talks.\n\nHe drew the Trump administration’s ire last weekend when he said a draft minerals deal with Washington did not contain the security provisions that Kyiv needed.\n\nThree sources said the US had proposed taking ownership of 50 per cent of Ukraine's critical minerals, apparently in compensation for vital US military aid, a demand some Trump critics have likened to extortion.\n\n‘Russia won round one’\n\nDr Emma Ashford, senior fellow at Stimson Centre think tank in Washington, said the Trump administration may have been justified in keeping the talks limited for now.\n\n“It’s certainly not ideal that Ukraine was not in the room, though I believe they’ll be at future such meetings,” she said. “But the administration is probably right that including a variety of European partners in the room might make for too many voices and make any progress more difficult.”\n\nStill, Democrat Jake Auchincloss, who is a co-chair of the House of Representatives’ Ukraine caucus, said Russia had won round one.\n\n“The Kremlin has been normalised in bilateral diplomacy that excludes Ukraine and Nato, and they gave up nothing to get that,” he told Reuters.\n\nThree Western intelligence officials told Reuters they have seen no new evidence that suggests Mr Putin’s goals have changed, saying he intends to hold all the territory his forces have taken with the long-term aim of expanding his reach inside Europe.\n\n“Putin will not stop at Ukraine,” Mr Darius Jauniskis, director of Lithuania’s State Security Department, told Reuters. “Is there a sincere desire to end the war? I don’t think so.”\n\nMr Trump’s fellow Republican, Mr Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, agreed Mr Putin could not be trusted in Ukraine talks.\n\n“Putin is a war criminal,” Mr Wicker told CNN.\n\nWhen asked about Mr Trump’s comment that he believes Mr Putin wants peace, Mr Wicker added: “What we can trust the Russians to do, is to do anything to their advantage, to take temporary steps.” REUTERS\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you."

But Moscow's ability in recent years to export has been hobbled by the war in Ukraine, making New Delhi look westward.\n\nA spokesperson for Russian state arms exporter Rosoboronexport told reporters the fighter jet could go into production as early as this year if the Indian government accepts its offer.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIndia's defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA Russian industry source and an Indian official said an informal offer had been made by Russia in talks with officials of the Indian government and state-owned planemaker Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.\n\nThe move comes as the Indian Air Force is keen to shore up its fighter squadrons, which have fallen to 31 from a target of 42, at a time when rival China is expanding its own air force.\n\nMaking the aircraft in India, with a full transfer of technology, will ensure that production and maintenance will not be affected by Western sanctions on Russia, the Rosoboronexport spokesperson told reporters on the sidelines of the Aero India aerospace exhibition in the southern city of Bengaluru. He declined to share his name.\n\nHe said the jet could be produced with enhancements to the Indian production line of the Sukhoi Su-30 aircraft, 260 of which are in the Indian Air Force's fleet.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBoth the Su-57 and rival Lockheed Martin's F-35 Lightning II, a fifth generation stealth fighter jet of the U.S., were on display at the Aero India exhibition.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government has been stressing the need to make India a global manufacturing hub and boost domestic defence production in order to achieve self reliance.\n\nDespite being touted as a Russian fifth-generation fighter aircraft to rival its U.S. equivalent, the Su-57 was plagued by development delays and a crash in 2019. According to its manufacturer, serial production of the aircraft began in 2022.\n\nLast year, Russia flew the SU-57, to Zhuhai in China for its first air show abroad, in an apparent message to the West about China-Russia cooperation.\n\n(Reporting by Shivam Patel and Abhijith Ganapavaram in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernadette Baum)"

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nTrump threatens Russia and other countries with sanctions, tariffs if Ukraine deal not reached\n\n- US President Donald Trump said on Jan 22 that he would add new tariffs to his sanctions threat against Russia if the country does not make a deal to end its war in Ukraine, and added that these also could be applied to “other participating countries”.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Mr Trump modified comments he made on Jan 21 that he would likely impose sanctions against Russia if President Vladimir Putin refused to negotiate an end to the nearly three-year invasion.\n\n“If we don’t make a ‘deal’, and soon, I have no other choice but to put high levels of taxes, tariffs and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States, and various other participating countries,” Mr Trump said.\n\nHis post did not identify the countries that he considered participants in the conflict, or how he defined participation.\n\nFormer US president Joe Biden’s administration heaped heavy sanctions on thousands of entities in Russia’s banking, defence, manufacturing, energy, technology and other sectors since Moscow’s February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has killed tens of thousands of people and reduced cities to rubble.\n\nRussia’s deputy UN ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said Moscow will have to see what Mr Trump thinks a “deal” to end the war in Ukraine means.\n\n“It’s not merely the question of ending the war,” Mr Polyanskiy told Reuters. “It’s first and foremost the question of addressing root causes of the Ukrainian crisis.”\n\nIn the run-up to his Nov 5 election victory, Mr Trump declared dozens of times that he would have a deal in place between Ukraine and Russia on his first day in office, if not before.\n\nBut his aides have conceded that a deal to end the war could take months or longer.\n\nEarlier in January, the US Treasury hit Russia’s energy revenues with its hardest sanctions yet, targeting oil and gas producers Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, as well as 183 vessels that are part of the so-called shadow fleet of tankers aimed at evading other Western trade curbs.\n\nMr Trump has sought to use the threat of tariffs to achieve non-trade goals, including threatening Mexico, Canada and China with duties to push them to stop illegal migration and the flow of the deadly opioid fentanyl into the US.\n\nThose three countries are the US’ top trading partners, accounting for more than US$2.1 trillion (S$2.85 trillion) in annual two-way trade.\n\nBut Russia is far down the list, with US imports from Russia falling to just US$2.9 billion through the first 11 months of 2024, from US$29.6 billion in 2021.\n\nThe US imported US$13.5 billion worth of Russian petroleum products in 2014, but this has fallen to zero after Ukraine war-related sanctions.\n\nSome other top import categories a decade ago, including semi-finished steel and pig iron, have also fallen to zero.\n\nThe US still imports significant amounts of Russian fertiliser used in agriculture – about US$1.4 billion worth in 2023 – as well as more than US$1 billion each worth of uranium for nuclear power use and palladium and rhodium used in automotive catalytic converters.\n\nMr Tim Brightbill, a trade attorney at law firm Wiley Rein in Washington, said: “One way to hit Russia hard would be to sanction and stop the use of Russian wood in finished wood products coming from China, Vietnam and other countries.”\n\nAs for other participants, the Biden administration had imposed sanctions against entities in North Korea and Iran for weapons supplies to Russia, and against Chinese entities that supply components and other goods to Russia’s war effort.\n\nMr Trump said he was “going to do Russia, whose Economy is failing, and President Putin, a very big FAVOUR. Settle now, and STOP this ridiculous War!”.\n\nThe negotiating positions of the two warring sides remain far apart, and some Ukrainians fear they could be forced to make massive concessions after three years of brutal combat.\n\nThe conflict has developed into a war of attrition, largely fought along front lines in eastern Ukraine, with huge numbers of casualties on both sides.

Mr Putin has in recent months described China as an “ally”.\n\nMr Putin, 72, speaking from his Novo-Ogarevo residency outside Moscow, and Mr Xi, 71, speaking from the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, called each other “dear friends”, and Mr Xi told Mr Putin about a call with Mr Trump on Jan 17 on TikTok, trade and Taiwan.\n\nBoth leaders “have indicated a willingness to build relations with the United States on a mutually beneficial, mutually respectful basis, if the Trump team really shows interest in this,” Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters in Moscow. “It was also noted from our side that we are ready for dialogue with the new US administration on the Ukrainian conflict.”\n\nMr Ushakov said Mr Putin wanted long-term peace in Ukraine, not a short-term ceasefire, but any deal must take into account Russia’s interests. No specific proposals for a call with Mr Trump have been received, he said.\n\nMr Trump has said he will be tough on China and speak to Mr Putin about ending the war in Ukraine. In remarks to reporters after his inauguration, the US President said Mr Putin should make a deal to end the war because the conflict was destroying Russia.\n\nRussia and China have increasingly found common geopolitical cause. Mr Xi has called for talks to end the war in Ukraine and has accused the US of stoking the war with weapons supplies to Kyiv, which also says it is ready to seek a negotiated solution that respects its interests.\n\nMr Trump told The Wall Street Journal in October that Mr Xi was “a good poker player” and that he got along “great” with Mr Putin, but that during his first term, he had warned Mr Putin that the US could strike Moscow if Russia went farther in Ukraine.\n\nMr Putin and Mr Xi share a broad world view, which portrays the West as decadent and in decline as China challenges US supremacy in many areas.\n\n“We jointly advocate building a more just multi-polar world order, and we are working in the interests of ensuring indivisible security in the Eurasian space and in the world as a whole,” Mr Putin said.\n\n\n\nMr Ushakov said the Putin-Xi video call had been planned before Mr Trump’s inauguration.\n\nThe United States casts China as its biggest competitor and Russia as its biggest nation-state threat.\n\nFormer US President Joe Biden has said the world’s democracies face a challenge from “autocracies” such as China and Russia.\n\nChina is the largest consumer of Russian energy, and the biggest single oil export market for Russia, Mr Putin said, adding that they would push ahead with cooperation on cooperating on fast neutron reactors and reprocessing nuclear fuel.\n\nOn Taiwan, Mr Ushakov said Russia had “confirmed its unwavering position of support for the one-China principle”.\n\nMr Xi said in a New Year’s speech that no one could stop China’s “reunification” with Taiwan, a clear warning to what Beijing regards as pro-independence forces within and outside of the island of 23 million people.\n\nChina regards democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory. Taiwan’s government rejects Beijing’s claims and says only its people can decide their future and Beijing ought to respect the choice of the Taiwanese people.

It showed five men in ghillie suits in a forested area, although other details were hard to make out.\n\nA video posted by the SBU appeared to show the two captured men. One had his jaw bandaged, due to an apparent wound, while the other was drinking through a straw.\n\nA doctor interviewed for the SBU’s video, who was not named and had his face blurred, said one of the soldiers had a facial wound and would be treated by a dentist, while the other soldier had an open wound and a lower leg fracture.\n\nThe SBU said the North Koreans had been transferred to Kyiv for questioning, and that because they could not speak Ukrainian, Russian or English, their questioning was being done in Korean with the help of South Korea’s NIS intelligence agency.\n\nThe SBU said one of the soldiers had been captured with a Russian military document with the name of another person registered in Russia, while the other did not have any documents.\n\nThe agency said the soldiers had been born in 2005 and 1999, and had been serving in the North Korean armed forces since 2021 and 2016 respectively.\n\nThe SBU said the two prisoners were being held in conditions that were in accordance with international law, and that a criminal investigation was being conducted to see if the men broke Ukraine’s law against planning or conducting a war.

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nNorth Korea becoming better prepared for war by fighting against Ukraine, warns US\n\nUNITED NATIONS - The US warned on Jan 8 that North Korea is benefiting from its troops fighting alongside Russia against Ukraine, gaining experience that makes Pyongyang “more capable of waging war against its neighbours”.\n\nRussia has forged closer diplomatic and military ties with North Korea since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nMore than 12,000 North Korean troops are in Russia and in December began fighting against Ukrainian forces in Russia’s Kursk region, US Deputy Ambassador to the UN Dorothy Shea told the United Nations Security Council.\n\n“The DPRK is significantly benefiting from receiving Russian military equipment, technology and experience, rendering it more capable of waging war against its neighbours,” Ms Shea told the council, which met over what Pyongyang said was a test of a new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile on Jan 6.\n\n“In turn, the DPRK will likely be eager to leverage these improvements to promote weapons sales and military training contracts globally,” she said, using the acronym for North Korea’s formal name – the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\n\nNorth Korea’s UN Ambassador Kim Song justified the Jan 6 missile test as part of a plan to enhance the country’s defence capabilities. He accused the US of double standards.\n\n“When the civilian death toll exceeded 45,000 in Gaza, the United States embellished Israel’s nefarious mass killing atrocity as the right to self-defence... Meanwhile, it takes issue with legitimate exercise of the right to self-defence of the DPRK,” Mr Kim told the Security Council.\n\nRussia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia repeated Moscow’s longstanding accusation that the US, South Korea and Japan provoke North Korea with military exercises. He also rejected as “wholly unsubstantiated” a US allegation that Russia intends to share satellite and space technology with Pyongyang.\n\n\"Such statements are the latest example of baseless conjecture which is geared towards smearing bilateral cooperation between the Russian Federation and the friendly nation of the DPRK,\" said Mr Nebenzia, who also congratulated North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on his birthday on Jan 8 .\n\nSouth Korea’s UN Ambassador Joonkook Hwang told the council that North Korea’s soldiers were “essentially slaves to Kim Jong Un, brainwashed to sacrifice their lives on faraway battlefields to raise money for his regime and secure advanced military technology from Russia”.\n\nNorth Korea has been under UN sanctions since 2006, and the measures have been steadily strengthened over the years with the aim of halting Pyongyang’s development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.\n\nRussia has veto power on the 15-member body, so any further council action is unlikely.

PHOTO: AFP\n\nSeveral wounded N. Korean soldiers died after being captured by Ukraine: Zelensky\n\n- Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec 27 that “several” wounded North Korean soldiers had died after being captured by his country’s forces, as he accused Russia of throwing them into battle with “minimal protection”.\n\nUkraine and its Western allies say North Korea has sent thousands of soldiers to support Russia’s army, in what is seen as a major escalation in the nearly three-year war following Moscow’s 2022 invasion.\n\n“Today, there were reports about several soldiers from North Korea. Our soldiers managed to take them prisoner. But they were very seriously wounded and could not be resuscitated,” Mr Zelensky said, in an evening address posted on social media.\n\nSouth Korea’s spy agency said earlier on Dec 27 that a North Korean soldier who was captured while fighting in Russia’s war against Ukraine had died of his wounds.\n\nMr Zelensky did not specify how many North Koreans had died after being captured by Ukrainian troops.\n\nMr Zelensky had earlier said that nearly 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been “killed or wounded” so far as they joined Russia’s forces in combat in its western Kursk border region, where Ukraine mounted a shock incursion in August.\n\nSouth Korea’s intelligence service had previously put the number of killed or wounded North Koreans at 1,000, saying the high casualty rate could be down to an unfamiliar battlefield environment and their lack of capability to counter drone attacks.\n\nThe White House on Dec 27 confirmed the South Korean estimates, saying that Pyongyang’s troops were being sent to their deaths in futile attacks by generals who see them as “expendable”.\n\n“We also have reports of North Korean soldiers taking their own lives rather than surrendering to Ukrainian forces, likely out of fear of reprisal against their families in North Korea in the event that they’re captured,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.\n\nPutin message to Kim\n\nNorth Korea and Russia have strengthened their military ties since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nA landmark defence agreement between Pyongyang and Moscow signed in June came into force in December, with Russian President Vladimir Putin hailing it as a “breakthrough document”.\n\nNorth Korean state media on Dec 27 said Mr Putin sent a New Year’s message to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying: “The bilateral ties between our two countries have been elevated after our talks in June in Pyongyang.”\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of throwing North Korean soldiers into battle with “minimal protection”. PHOTO: AFP\n\nSouth Korea’s military believes the North is seeking to modernise its conventional warfare capabilities through combat experience gained in the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nNato chief Mark Rutte had also said Moscow was providing support to Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear programmes in exchange for the troops.\n\nSouth Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff on Dec 23 said Pyongyang is reportedly “preparing for the rotation or additional deployment of soldiers” and supplying “240mm rocket launchers and 170mm self-propelled artillery” to the Russian army.\n\nPyongyang’s involvement in Russia’s war against Ukraine had prompted warnings from Seoul.\n\nSouth Korea’s President Yoon Suk Yeol, who is currently suspended, had said in November that Seoul was “not ruling out the possibility of providing weapons” to Ukraine, a move which would mark a major shift in a longstanding policy barring the sale of weapons to countries in active conflict.

PHOTO: AFP\n\n– Lines of Russian troops in desert khaki greeted President Vladimir Putin in Syria in 2017. Declaring that Moscow had accomplished its mission in Syria’s civil war, Mr Putin pledged that Russia was there to stay.\n\n“If the terrorists raise their heads again,” he said on the tarmac of a Russian airbase, “we will deal unprecedented strikes unlike anything they have seen”.\n\nBut over the past two weeks, as rebels whom Russia called terrorists swept across Syria aiming to topple one of Moscow’s closest allies, President Bashar al-Assad, those “unprecedented” strikes were nowhere to be seen.\n\nInstead, with Mr Assad’s ouster on Dec 8, Mr Putin has suffered one of the biggest geopolitical setbacks of his quarter-century in power.\n\nHe took that blow, analysts said, in large part because his military is bogged down in Ukraine.\n\n“Our involvement over there had a cost,” a Moscow-based analyst focusing on the Middle East, Mr Anton Mardasov, said, referring to Russia’s war in Ukraine. “The cost was Syria.”\n\nBy Dec 8, Russia had been reduced from kingmaker to bystander.\n\nIts Foreign Ministry issued a statement of “extreme concern” about “the dramatic events” and announced that Mr Assad had left the country. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies that he had nothing to add. Mr Putin has said nothing about Syria in recent weeks.\n\nThe extent of the fallout for Russia of Mr Assad’s removal is still to be determined.\n\nThe key question, analysts said, is whether Russia manages to strike an agreement with Syria’s new government to hold on to its Tartus naval base and its Hmeimim airbase, where Mr Putin delivered that victory speech in 2017.\n\nMr Mardasov said he was unsure whether Moscow would be able to strike such a deal, given that Russia used those bases for overwhelming air strikes against Syria’s opposition after the Kremlin intervened in Syria’s civil war in 2015.\n\nLosing the Syrian bases would thwart some of Mr Putin’s ambitions to re-establish Russia as a world power, since they are crucial to the Kremlin’s ability to flex its muscles in places as far away as West Africa.\n\n“Syria is their only real foothold in the Middle East and the Mediterranean,” said Dr Eugene Rumer, director of the Russia and Eurasia programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. The rebel victory, he said, has become “part of the price they are paying for the war in Ukraine”.\n\nDetained members of the the Syrian government’s security forces gathered in a field by rebel soldiers on Dec 8 in Homs, Syria. PHOTO: EPA-EFE\n\nThe Kremlin is also likely to bear a broader cost to its image.\n\nIn Mr Putin’s widening conflict with the West, he has been trying to position Russia as a decisive, reliable leader of a global coalition against what he calls American hegemony.\n\n“What good is Russia as a partner if it cannot save its oldest client in the Middle East from a ragtag band of militias?” Dr Rumer asked. “Besides the operational setback, it is also a diplomatic and reputational blow.”\n\nJust a few years ago, Syria stood out as the biggest symbol of Russia’s resurgence on the world stage. Its sweeping, bloody air strikes bombed opposition groups into submission and turned the fighting in Mr Assad’s favour, sending the message that Russia was prepared to use overwhelming force to stand by its allies and assert its own interests.\n\nThe United States, by contrast, was increasingly seen in the region as an unreliable power that was disengaging from the Middle East.\n\nAnd after Mr Assad’s grip on authority seemed secure, Russia used its Syrian bases as a staging point to compete for influence with the West in African countries like Libya, Mali and the Central African Republic.\n\nBut after Mr Putin invaded Ukraine in 2022, Syria plummeted on the Kremlin’s priority list. Russia’s bases in Syria became known as places where commanders who had failed in Ukraine were put out to pasture, and as a draw for soldiers hoping to avoid the trenches of Ukraine.\n\nThe focus on Ukraine left Russia flat-footed when the new rebel offensive began in Syria. Russia launched strikes against the Syrian rebels, but with far less intensity than at the height of its intervention in the civil war.\n\nA US official said Washington believed that this was because many Russian aircraft had been pulled out of Syria for operations in Ukraine.\n\nWarplanes that Russia may have otherwise sent to reprise the brutal bombing campaigns were instead committed to Ukraine. Warships that Russia might have dispatched from the Black Sea were unable to transit into the Mediterranean because of a treaty that allows Turkey to close its straits to the navy of a nation at war.\n\nAnd a once-fearsome Russian mercenary force, the Wagner Group, had its Syrian operations dissolved in 2023 after its leader Yevgeny Prigozhin staged a failed mutiny against Russian military chiefs.\n\n“The priorities totally changed,” said Mr Denis Korotkov, a Russian journalist who was among the first to document the Wagner group. “There was no time for Syria.”\n\nRussia’s support of the Assad regime dated back to the Soviet Union’s backing of Mr Assad’s father, president Hafez Assad, in the 1970s. Now, Russia appears to be turning to diplomacy to try to salvage its footprint in Syria.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov held talks with his Iranian and Turkish counterparts in Qatar on Dec 7, and Mr Putin has spoken by phone with the leaders of those two countries in recent days.\n\nIn a sign that Moscow could seek accommodation with Syria’s new powers, Russian state television on Dec 8 appeared to soften the language it used to refer to the forces that toppled Mr Assad.\n\nOn the night of Dec 7, state television broadcasts referred to them as “terrorists” or “militants” backed by foreign powers. By the morning of Dec 8, Russian state media had started calling them “armed opposition” or “armed groups”.\n\nRussia’s best hope, analysts say, may be to negotiate with Turkey – which backs some of the rebel groups – to help it maintain its Syrian bases.\n\nBut it is far from clear that Turkey would have the power or influence to persuade the rebels to accept such a deal.

PHOTO: PHILIPPINE NAVY\n\n‘Black hole’ Russian sub spotted in Philippine waters as Moscow reminds US: We’re everywhere\n\nOne of Russia’s stealthiest submarines has been spotted cruising in waters claimed by the Philippines.\n\nThis incident could be Russia signalling to the US that it is prepared to help China amid an escalating stand-off in the South China Sea, one analyst said.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said in a news conference on Dec 2 that the submarine’s presence in his nation’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) is very concerning.\n\n“Any intrusion into the West Philippine Sea, of our EEZ, of our baselines, is very worrisome,” he said.\n\nThe Philippine Daily Inquirer reported on Dec 2 that the Russian Navy’s Ufa attack submarine was spotted after it surfaced 148km west of Mindoro province on Nov 28.\n\nThe Philippine Navy said in a statement that it sent the guided missile frigate BRP Jose Rizal to track the submarine as it made its way – while remaining surfaced – outside Philippine waters.\n\nPhilippine Navy spokesman Rear-Admiral Roy Vincent Trinidad said the frigate communicated with the Ufa to ascertain its identity and intention.\n\n“The Russian vessel stated it was awaiting improved weather conditions before proceeding to Vladivostok,” he said.\n\nThe Russian state-run Tass news agency had reported that the submarine, together with rescue tug Alatau, were operating in the South China Sea after stopping at the RMN Kota Kinabalu Naval Base in Malaysia on Nov 23 for a port visit and to hold exercises.\n\nIt was due to return to the Russian Pacific Fleet’s submarine base at the Kamchatka peninsula in Russia’s Far East, it said.\n\nRear-Adm Trinidad said the incident was not alarming. “But we were surprised because this is a very unique submarine,” he told Agence France-Presse.\n\nStealthiest subs\n\nThe Ufa is one of six Project 636.3 attack submarines dubbed as “black holes” for their reputation as among the stealthiest in Russia’s submarine fleet.\n\nIt is a Kilo-class submarine powered by a hybrid diesel and electric engine, upgraded to make it even more quiet when cruising underwater. It is armed with Kalibr cruise missiles that have been used in Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Ufa was commissioned in 2022 and initially used to patrol the Baltic Sea.\n\nTass reported in October that the submarine was deployed from the Baltic to the Pacific to shore up Russia’s naval fleet in the Far East.\n\nThat a submarine known for stealth will surface in contested waters may be Russia’s way of telling the US that it, too, is a player in waters far from its shores, and where its allies are locked in territorial disputes, an analyst said.\n\n“Maybe this is a signal from the Russians… They may have intentionally surfaced the sub to say, ‘We’re just here’,” Dr Eduardo Araral, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore, told The Straits Times.\n\nHe said it could be the Russians telling the Americans, “if you threaten us, we can threaten you back”.\n\nDr Araral, who has advised the Philippine government on public policies, said it is also not surprising that Russian submarines are now operating in the South China Sea, as Russia has been stepping up its participation in war drills with its Pacific allies.\n\n“Russia is a close friend of China. So if China invites them (for a military exercise), they will come and join,” he said.\n\nTit-for-tat\n\nRussia and China held massive naval and air drills in September – dubbed Ocean-2024 – involving more than 400 warships, at least 120 aircraft and some 90,000 troops.\n\nAnalysts say these drills were meant to push back against efforts by the US and its allies in the Indo-Pacific region to deepen and expand their security ties as a check to China’s aspirations.\n\n“Russia wants to demonstrate that they can engage in a full-scale war with Ukraine while deploying resources to the Indo-Pacific region, and China wants to show that they can deepen its relationship with Russia and cause problems in the region, primarily in the South China Sea but also around Japan,” Dr Stephen Nagy, a regional security expert at the International Christian University in Japan, told Voice Of America in September.\n\nThe Philippines – a long-time US ally – has figured in increasingly confrontational skirmishes with China since Mr Marcos became President in 2022 and took a more muscular approach against Beijing than his predecessor did.\n\nChina’s coast guard ships have been swarming and colliding with Philippine resupply ships, chasing or boarding them, and sinking fishing boats.\n\nIn the latest incident, a Chinese military helicopter was seen on Nov 28 aggressively flying over a group of Philippine fishing boats off Iroquis reef in the Spratly archipelago in the South China Sea.\n\nThe reef has become the latest flashpoint stirring up clashes between Manila and Beijing, as China’s seaborne militia have been spotted swarming around it in what security analysts suggest is a sign that China is preparing to build another island fortress on it.\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you."

PHOTO: AFP\n\nSyrian opposition fighters standing in front of University of Aleppo on Nov 30. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nRebel fighters in Aleppo, Syria, on Nov 30, following a bold assault, which poses the biggest challenge to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in years. PHOTO: EPA-EFE\n\n– The Syrian army said on Nov 30 that dozens of its soldiers had been killed in a major attack led by Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham rebels who swept into the city of Aleppo, forcing the army to redeploy in the biggest challenge to President Bashar al-Assad in years.\n\nRussia’s Defence Ministry said its air force had carried out strikes on Syrian rebels in support of the country’s army, Russian news agencies reported.\n\nThe strikes followed what was the boldest rebel assault for years in a civil war where front lines had largely been frozen since 2020.\n\nHayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, once known as the Nusra Front, is designated a terrorist group by the US, Russia, Turkey and other states. Mr Assad is a close Moscow ally.\n\nA spokesperson for the US State Department said earlier that the US was monitoring the situation.\n\nThe war – which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced many millions – has ground on since 2011 with no formal end, although most major fighting halted years ago after Iran and Russia helped Mr Assad’s government win control of most land and all major cities.\n\nAleppo had been firmly held by the government since a 2016 victory there, one of the war’s major turning points, when Russian-backed Syrian forces besieged and laid waste to rebel-held eastern areas of what had been the country’s largest city.\n\n“I am a son of Aleppo and was displaced from it eight years ago, in 2016. Thank God, we just returned. It is an indescribable feeling,” said Mr Ali Jumaa, a rebel fighter, in TV footage filmed inside the city.\n\nAcknowledging the rebel advance, the Syrian army command said insurgents had entered much of Aleppo.\n\nAfter the army said it was preparing a counter-attack, air strikes targeted rebel gatherings and convoys in the city, the pro-Damascus newspaper al-Watan reported. One strike caused casualties in Aleppo’s Basel square, a resident told Reuters.\n\nThe state-run Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of the Enemy Parties in Syria said missile and bomb strikes against the rebels had targeted “militant concentrations, command posts, depots and artillery positions” in Aleppo and Idlib provinces. It claimed about 300 rebel fighters had been killed in the attacks.\n\nOvernight, images from Aleppo showed a group of rebel fighters gathered in the city’s Saadallah al-Jabiri Square, with a billboard of Mr Assad looming behind them.\n\nImages filmed on Nov 30 showed people posing for photos on a toppled statue of Mr Bassel al-Assad, late brother of the president. Fighters zipped around the city in trucks and milled around in the streets. A man waved a Syrian opposition flag as he stood near Aleppo’s historic citadel.\n\nMore on this Topic What do we know about Syrian rebels’ major offensive on Aleppo?\n\nThe Syrian military command said militants had attacked in large numbers and from multiple directions, prompting “our armed forces to carry out a redeployment operation aimed at strengthening the defence lines in order to absorb the attack, preserve the lives of civilians and soldiers”.\n\nThe rebels also took control of Aleppo airport, according to a statement by their operations room and a security source.\n\nTwo rebel sources also said the insurgents had captured the city of Maarat al-Numan in Idlib province, bringing all of that area under their control.\n\nThe fighting revives the long-simmering Syrian conflict as the wider region is roiled by wars in Gaza and Lebanon, where a truce between Israel and the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah took effect on Nov 27.\n\nWith Mr Assad backed by Russia and Iran, and Turkey supporting some of the rebels in the north-west where it maintains troops, the offensive has brought into focus the conflict’s knotted geopolitics. Fighting in the north-west had largely abated since Turkey and Russia reached a de-escalation agreement in 2020.\n\nRussian, Turkish ministers talk\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov held a phone call with his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan discussing the situation in Syria, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said on Nov 30.\n\n“Both sides expressed serious concerns at the dangerous development of the situation,” the ministry said. They agreed it was necessary to coordinate joint actions to stabilise the situation in the country.\n\nTurkish security officials had said on Nov 28 that Ankara had prevented operations, which opposition groups wanted to organise, in order to avoid further tensions in the region.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Mr Lavrov in a phone call that the rebel attacks were part of an Israeli-US plan to destabilise the region, Iranian state media said.\n\nThe Syrian Civil Defence – a rescue service operating in opposition-held parts of Syria – said in a post on social media platform X that Syrian government and Russian aircraft carried out air strikes on residential neighbourhoods in rebel-held Idlib, killing four civilians and wounding six others.\n\nTwo Syrian military sources said Russia has promised Damascus extra military aid that would start arriving in the next 72 hours.\n\nThe Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG), which spearhead the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces that control much of north-eastern and eastern Syria and have long had a foothold in Aleppo, widened their control in the city as government troops left, a senior YPG source said.\n\nMr Mustafa Abdul Jaber, a commander in the Jaish al-Izza rebel brigade, said the rebels’ speedy advance had been helped by a lack of Iran-backed manpower to support the government in the broader Aleppo province.\n\nIran’s allies in the region have suffered a series of blows at the hands of Israel as the Gaza war has expanded through the Middle East.\n\nThe opposition fighters have said the campaign was in response to stepped-up strikes in recent weeks against civilians by the Russian and Syrian air forces on areas of Idlib province, and to pre-empt any attacks by the Syrian army.

Kremlin strongman spoke out after a day of frayed nerves, with Russia test-firing a new-generation intermediate-range missile at Ukraine – which Mr Putin hinted was capable of unleashing a nuclear payload.\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky branded the strike a major ramping up of the “scale and brutality” of the war by a “crazy neighbour”, while Kyiv’s main backer US said that Russia was to blame for escalating the conflict “at every turn”.\n\nIntermediate-range missiles typically have a reach of up to 5,500km – enough to make good on Mr Putin’s threat of striking the West.\n\nIn a defiant address to the nation, Russia’s president railed at Ukraine’s allies granting permission for Kyiv to use Western-supplied weapons to strike targets on Russian territory, warning of retaliation.\n\nIn recent days, Ukraine has fired US and UK-supplied missiles at Russian territory for the first time, escalating already sky-high tensions in the brutal nearly three-year-long conflict.\n\n“We consider ourselves entitled to use our weapons against the military facilities of those countries that allow their weapons to be used against our facilities,” Mr Putin said.\n\nHe said the US-sent Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and British Storm Shadow payloads were shot down by Moscow’s air defences, adding: “The goals that the enemy obviously set were not achieved”.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov did, however, say Moscow informed Washington of the missile’s launch half an hour before it was fired through an automatic nuclear de-escalation hotline, in remarks cited in state media.\n\nHe earlier said Russia was doing everything to avoid an atomic conflict, having updated its nuclear doctrine this week.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that Washington saw no need to modify the US’ own nuclear posture in response.\n\nNato spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah said Russia’s use of the missile would “neither change the course of the conflict nor deter” the US-led defence alliance from backing Kyiv.\n\n‘Reckless behaviour’\n\nUkraine had earlier accused Russia of firing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) for the first time in history, a claim later downplayed by Washington.\n\nUkrainian’s air force said Moscow had launched the missile as part of a barrage towards Dnipro, where the local authorities said an infrastructure facility was hit, and two civilians were wounded.\n\nMr Putin said that Russia had carried out “testing in combat conditions” of one of its newest missile systems named Oreshnik.\n\nCriticising the global response to the strike – “final proof that Russia definitely does not want peace” – Mr Zelensky warned that other countries could become targets for Mr Putin too.\n\n“It is necessary to urge Russia to a true peace, which is possible only through force,” the Ukrainian leader said in his evening address.\n\n“Otherwise, there will be relentless Russian strikes, threats and destabilisation, and not only against Ukraine.”\n\nThe attack on Dnipro comes just days after several foreign embassies shuttered temporarily in the Ukrainian capital, citing the threat of a large-scale strike.\n\n“It is another example of reckless behaviour from Russia,” a spokesman for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters.\n\nThe spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Mr Stephane Dujarric, said the new missile’s deployment was “another concerning and worrying development”, warning the war was “going in the wrong direction”.\n\nYet a US official played down the threat, saying on condition of anonymity that Russia “likely possesses only a handful of these” experimental missiles.\n\nUK ‘directly involved’\n\nThe head of the Dnipropetrovsk region where the city of Dnipro is located said the Russian aerial bombardment damaged a rehabilitation centre and several homes, as well as an industrial enterprise.\n\n“Two people were wounded – a 57-year-old man was treated on the scene and a 42-year-old woman was hospitalised,” said the official, Mr Sergiy Lysak.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have escalated their use of long-range missiles in recent days since Washington gave Kyiv permission to use its ATACMS against military targets inside Russia, a long-standing Ukrainian request.\n\nBritish media, meanwhile, reported on Nov 20 that Kyiv had launched UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles at targets in Russia after being given the green light from London.\n\nWith ranges of 300km and 250km respectively, both missile systems’ reach is far dwarfed by the experimental intermediate-range system fired by Russia.\n\nRussia’s envoy to London on Nov 21 said that meant Britain was “now directly involved” in the Ukraine war, with Mr Andrei Kelin telling Sky News “this firing cannot happen” without UK and Nato support.\n\nBut the White House’s Ms Jean-Pierre countered that it was Russia who was behind the rising tensions, pointing to the reported deployment of thousands of North Korean troops to help Moscow fight off a Ukrainian offensive in Russia’s border Kursk region.\n\n“The escalation at every turn is coming from Russia,” she said, adding that the United States had warned Moscow against involving “another country in another part of the world” – referring to Pyongyang.\n\nKyiv in retreat\n\nThe defence ministry in Moscow said on Nov 21 its air-defence systems had downed two Storm Shadows, without saying whether they had come down on Russian territory or in occupied Ukraine.\n\nThe missile escalation is coming at a critical moment on the ground for Ukraine, as its defences buckle under Russian pressure across the sprawling front line.\n\nRussia claimed deeper advances in the war-battered Donetsk region, announcing on Nov 21 that its forces had captured another village close to Kurakhove, closing in on the town after months of steady advances.\n\nMoscow’s defence ministry said Russian forces had taken the small village of Dalne, 5km south of Kurakhove.\n\nMr Lysak, the governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, said that 26 people had been wounded in another strike on the town of Kryvyi Rih, where Mr Zelensky was born.

PHOTO: EPA-EFE\n\n– Russia fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) during an attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Nov 21, Kyiv’s air force said, in what would be the first use in war of a weapon designed to deliver long-distance nuclear strikes.\n\nThe launch, if confirmed, highlights rapidly rising tensions in the 33-month-old Russia-Ukraine war after Kyiv fired US and British missiles at targets inside Russia this week despite warnings by Moscow that it would see such action as a major escalation.\n\nSecurity experts said it would be the first military use of an ICBM. The missiles are strategic weapons designed to deliver nuclear warheads and are an important part of Russia’s nuclear deterrent.\n\n“Today, there was a new Russian missile. All the characteristics – speed, altitude – are (of an) intercontinental ballistic (missile). An expert (investigation) is currently under way,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video statement.\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force said the missile was fired from the Russian region of Astrakhan, more than 700km from Dnipro in central-eastern Ukraine. It did not specify what kind of warhead the missile had or what type of missile it was.\n\nThere was no suggestion it was nuclear-armed.\n\nAsked about the air force’s statement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters to contact Russian military for comment.\n\nDuring a weekly briefing, Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova received a phone call in which she was told by an unidentified man not to comment, video footage showed.\n\nUkrainska Pravda, a Kyiv-based media outlet, cited anonymous sources saying the missile was an RS-26 Rubezh, a solid-fuelled ICBM with a range of 5,800km, according to the Arms Control Association.\n\nThe RS-26 was first successfully tested in 2012, and is estimated to be 12m long and weigh 36 tonnes, according to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). It said the RS-26 can carry an 800kg nuclear warhead.\n\nThe RS-26 is classified as an ICBM under a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the US and Russia, but it can be seen as an intermediate-range ballistic missile when used with heavier payloads at ranges below 5,500km, CSIS said.\n\nThe Russian missile attack targeted enterprises and critical infrastructure in the central-eastern city of Dnipro, the air force said.\n\nUkraine’s air force did not say what the ICBM targeted or whether it had caused any damage, but regional governor Serhiy Lysak said the missile attack damaged an industrial enterprise and set off fires in Dnipro. Two people were hurt.\n\nRussia also fired a Kinzhal hypersonic missile and seven Kh-101 cruise missiles, six of which were shot down, the Ukrainian Air Force said.\n\n‘Totally unprecedented’\n\nThe Nato military alliance did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The US European Command said it had nothing on the reported use of an ICBM and referred questions to the US Department of Defence.\n\n“If true, this will be totally unprecedented and the first actual military use of ICBM. Not that it makes a lot of sense given their price and precision,” Mr Andrey Baklitskiy, of the UN Institute for Disarmament Research, posted on X.\n\nGerman security expert Ulrich Kuehn posted: “It looks as if Russia has today used an intercontinental ballistic missile in a war for the first time in history, against the civilian target Dnipro.”\n\nSome military experts said the ICBM launch, if confirmed, could be seen as an act of deterrence by Moscow following Kyiv’s strikes into Russia with Western weapons this week.\n\n“An ICBM launch can certainly be seen as a threatening gesture, potentially in response to the lifting of restrictions on ATACMS and Storm Shadow. It’s a means of deterrence,” said a European military source.\n\nRussian war correspondents on Telegram and an official speaking on condition of anonymity said Kyiv fired British Storm Shadow cruise missiles into Russia’s Kursk region bordering Ukraine on Nov 20.\n\nRussia’s Defence Ministry, in its daily report of events over the previous 24 hours on Nov 21, said air defences had shot down two British Storm Shadow cruise missiles but did not say where.\n\nBritain had previously let Ukraine use Storm Shadows within Ukrainian territory.\n\nResidents looking on at the site of a Russian missile strike in Dnipro, Ukraine, on Nov 21. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nUkraine also fired US ATACMS missiles into Russia on Nov 19 after US President Joe Biden gave the all-clear to use such missiles, two months before he leaves office and Donald Trump returns to the White House. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Nov 19 lowered the threshold for a nuclear strike in response to a broader range of conventional attacks.\n\nTrump has said he will end the war, without saying how, and criticised billions of dollars in aid for Ukraine under Mr Biden. The warring sides believe Trump is likely to push for peace talks – not known to have been held since the war’s earliest months – and are trying to attain strong positions before negotiations.\n\nMoscow has said the use of Western weapons to strike Russian territory far from the border would be a major escalation in the conflict. Kyiv says it needs the capability to defend itself by hitting Russian rear bases used to support Moscow’s February 2022 invasion.

SCREENSHOT: X\n\nLONDON - Ukraine has fired UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles into Russia for the first time, British media reported on Nov 20, after being given the green light from London.\n\nSeveral missiles were launched against at least one Russian military target, the Financial Times said, citing an unidentified Western official.\n\nThe Times said government sources had confirmed the use of the long-range missiles for the first time.\n\nThe Guardian said Britain had given Ukraine permission to use the missiles in Russia in response to Moscow’s deployment of North Korean troops on the border.\n\nThe strikes were also widely reported by Russian war correspondents on Telegram and confirmed by an official on condition of anonymity. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s General Staff said he had no information.\n\nRussian pro-Kremlin military bloggers wrote that around a dozen Storm Shadow missiles were fired on a target in the Kursk border region, which is partially held by Ukrainian forces.\n\nUkrainian media posted aerial video footage from a drone showing a series of explosions at what appears to be a country estate, naming the location as Maryino, where the presidential administration has a sanatorium.\n\nUkrainian media reported the strikes could have targeted an underground military command centre.\n\nNeither Moscow nor Kyiv have officially confirmed the missile attack or the use of Storm Shadows.\n\nA spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer declined to comment.\n\nBritain had previously allowed Ukraine to use Storm Shadows, which have a range in excess of 250km, within Ukrainian territory.\n\nThe reported attack came after Washington this week said it had cleared Ukraine to use its ATACMS against military targets inside Russia – a long-standing Ukrainian request.\n\nRussia said on Nov 19 that the missiles had been used to target a military facility in the Bryansk border region.\n\nThe reported strikes came as Moscow looks to retaliate against Ukraine for firing US-supplied long-range missiles on Russian territory for the first time and with the Kremlin accusing outgoing US President Joe Biden of dragging out the war.\n\nRussia has ramped up deadly missile strikes in recent days, targeting residential areas and Ukraine’s energy grid.\n\nAir alerts blare out across the country daily.\n\nThe United States said on Nov 20 morning that it was shutting its Kyiv office to the public after having received “specific information of a potential significant air attack”.\n\nCanada, Greece, Hungary, Italy and Spain – all Nato members – followed suit.\n\nThe US embassy said on Nov 20 evening that it would reopen on Nov 21, after having “temporarily modified operations” due to a warning of a “potential imminent air attack”.\n\nThe French embassy remained open but urged its citizens to be cautious. The Kremlin said it had no comment.\n\nStrikes a ‘daily reality’\n\nUkrainian officials criticised the rare move and called on its allies not to spread yet more fear among Ukrainian society.\n\n“We remind you that the threat of strikes by the aggressor state has unfortunately been a daily reality for Ukrainians for over 1,000 days,” Ukraine’s foreign ministry posted on social media.\n\nAir alert sirens sounded in Kyiv on Nov 20 and the authorities said falling debris from an intercepted drone attack in the morning caused minor damage.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address that the “panic messages that were reposted” on social media “only helps Russia”.\n\nNerves are already frayed in Kyiv after almost three years of war, and Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election has injected fresh uncertainty.\n\nThe Republican has repeatedly criticised US support for Ukraine and claimed he could broker a ceasefire within hours – comments that have triggered fears in Kyiv and Europe about Ukraine’s ability to withstand the Russian attacks without American support.\n\nBoth Ukraine and Russia are jockeying for upper hand on the battlefield before Trump re-enters the White House in January.\n\nAnticipating Trump administration\n\nTrump, who has said he will end the war, without saying how, has criticised the billions of dollars in aid for Ukraine under the Biden administration.\n\nThe warring sides believe he is likely to push for peace talks – not known to have been held since the war's earliest months – and are trying to attain strong positions before negotiations.\n\nRussia on Nov 20 accused Mr Biden of prolonging the war by stepping up weapons deliveries to Kyiv in his final weeks in office.\n\n“If you look at the trends of the outgoing US administration, they are fully committed to continuing the war in Ukraine and are doing everything they can to do so,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nMr Peskov was responding to the US saying it would soon provide Ukraine with anti-personnel land mines.\n\nThis decision has prompted criticism from charities over the long-term risk to civilians, but Mr Zelensky said in his evening address that landmines were “very important... to stop Russian assaults”.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Nov 20 that Russian forces “lead with dismounted forces” rather than tanks, and landmines “can help slow down that effort”.\n\nWestern countries say the arrival of more than 10,000 North Korean troops to fight for Russia in recent weeks was an escalation that merited a response.\n\nThe war is at a volatile juncture, with nearly a fifth of Ukrainian territory in Russian hands, North Korean troops deployed in Russia’s Kursk region and doubts over the future of Western aid under Trump, whose nominees for administration posts include sceptics of support for Kyiv.\n\n‘Big mistake’\n\nWorld leaders have taken note of the stepped-up American support for Kyiv.\n\nTurkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a Nato ally of the US, said on Nov 20 that the decision to allow Kyiv to use the powerful long-range missiles was a “big mistake”.\n\n“This step by Biden will not only escalate the conflict, but will lead to a greater reaction from Russia,” Mr Erdogan, who sees himself as a possible mediator, told journalists.\n\nMoscow has struck a defiant tone, pledging retribution and continuing its advance on the front lines. Its forces claimed on Nov 20 to have captured the village of Illinka, close to the strategic hub of Kurakhove in the eastern Donetsk region.\n\nThe Kremlin also rejected as “absurd” and “laughable” suggestions it was involved in the cutting of two telecommunications cables running under the Baltic Sea.\n\nEuropean officials have said they suspect “sabotage” and “hybrid warfare” linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDespite increased speculation of possible talks to end the conflict, there is no sign of Mr Zelensky or Russian President Vladimir Putin being anywhere close to converging on a possible deal.

PHOTO: NYTIMES\n\nUkraine hits Russia with US ATACMS missiles for first time on war’s 1,000th day\n\n- Ukraine used US ATACMS missiles to strike Russian territory on Nov 19, taking advantage of newly granted permission from the outgoing administration of US President Joe Biden on the war’s 1,000th day.\n\nRussia said its forces shot down five of six missiles fired at a military facility in the Bryansk region. Debris of one hit the facility, starting a fire that was swiftly put out and caused no casualties or damage, it said.\n\nUkraine said it struck a Russian arms depot about 110km inside Russia, an attack that caused secondary explosions. Ukraine’s military did not publicly specify the weapons used, but a Ukrainian government source and a US official confirmed it had used ATACMS.\n\nA US official said Russia intercepted two of eight missiles and that the strike was at an ammunition supply point.\n\nMr Biden gave approval this week for Ukraine to use ATACMS, the longest-range missiles Washington has supplied, for such attacks inside Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the use of ATACMS was a clear signal the West wanted to escalate the conflict.\n\nMoscow has said such weapons cannot be used without direct US operational support and their use would make Washington a direct combatant in the war, prompting Russian retaliation.\n\nThe attack took place as Ukraine marked 1,000 days of war, with a fifth of its territory in Russian hands and doubts about the future of Western support as President-elect Donald Trump heads back to the White House.\n\nAt the United Nations in New York, Ukraine’s UN ambassador, Mr Sergiy Kyslytsya, read a statement from his country and 42 others and the European Union, rejecting Russia’s “attempted illegal annexation” of Ukrainian territory and demanding immediate withdrawal.\n\n“One thousand days is a tragic reminder of the need to remain resolute in ensuring... that international law prevails, not just in Ukraine, but wherever it is challenged,” he said.\n\nMilitary experts say using the US missiles can help Ukraine defend a pocket of captured Russian territory in the Kursk region as a bargaining chip, but was not likely to have a decisive impact on the 33-month-old war, in part as the move comes far too late.\n\nThe missile’s range of up to 300km is much shorter than that of some Moscow has used to strike Ukraine, including its hypersonic Kinzhal weapon with a reported range of up to 2,000km.\n\nOn Nov 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a new nuclear doctrine that appeared intended as a warning to Washington. It lowers the threshold under which Russia might use atomic weapons to include responding to attacks that threaten its territorial integrity.\n\nWashington said the update to the nuclear doctrine was no surprise and rejected “more of the same irresponsible rhetoric from Russia”.\n\nMr Zelensky said the step showed Mr Putin had no interest in peace: “Especially on this day... they presented (a) nuclear weapons strategy. Why? They didn’t present (a) peace strategy. Did you hear it? Putin wants war.”\n\nThe Pentagon said the US State Department has approved another potential US$100 million (S$133 million) sale of military equipment and services to Ukraine, while Denmark said it was making a new donation of about US$138 million for development of Ukraine’s arms industry.\n\nTrump criticisms of aid\n\nTrump has criticised the scale of US aid to Kyiv and said he will end the war quickly, without saying how. Both sides appear to anticipate his return in two months will be accompanied by a push for peace talks, which are not known to have taken place since the war’s early months.\n\nThe warring sides have been escalating to try to secure a stronger position at any negotiations. Mr Zelensky says Kyiv must do everything for the war to end diplomatically in 2025.\n\n“At this stage of the war, it is being decided who will prevail. Whether us over the enemy, or the enemy over us Ukrainians... and Europeans. And everyone in the world who wants to live freely and not be subject to a dictator,” he told parliament.\n\nDozens of civilians and soldiers gathered for a moment’s silence at a candle-lit commemoration in the evening in Kyiv. Some sobbed.\n\n“My life has been turned upside down. There is no life for me. I only want victory and to return home. I am grateful to all the men defending our country,” said Yuliia, from the city of Mariupol, was captured by Russia in 2022.\n\nUN spokesman Stephane Dujarric cited data from the UN Human Rights Office that more than 12,000 civilians had been killed and nearly 27,000 injured in Ukraine over the past 1,000 days, with more than 2,400 child casualties.\n\nOver six million Ukrainians live as refugees abroad, and the population has fallen by a quarter since Mr Putin ordered the invasion that began Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II.\n\nMilitary losses are huge, although casualty figures remain secret. Public Western estimates based on intelligence reports say hundreds of thousands have been wounded or killed on each side.\n\nMembers of the EU Parliament welcoming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (on screen) ahead of his speech to EU lawmakers in Brussels on Nov 19. PHOTO: AFP\n\nIn the first year after the invasion, Ukrainian troops pushed Russian forces back from the outskirts of Kyiv and recaptured territory. Since then, relentless trench warfare has ground eastern Ukrainian cities to dust.\n\nIn a move described in the West as an escalation, Russia has deployed 11,000 North Korean troops, some of whom Kyiv says have clashed with Ukrainian forces in Kursk.\n\nMr Zelensky said Pyongyang could send 100,000 soldiers.\n\nMore on this Topic Zelensky addresses parliament as Ukraine marks 1,000 days of Russian invasion\n\nRussia for its part continues to advance slowly in eastern Ukraine, and said it captured another settlement on Nov 19.\n\nWith winter setting in, Moscow on Nov 17 renewed its aerial assault on Ukraine’s power system, launching the biggest barrage since August.\n\nThere has been no public narrowing of negotiating positions. Kyiv demands a full Russian withdrawal from all occupied territory and Western security guarantees comparable to membership in Nato’s mutual defence treaty to prevent future Russian attacks.\n\nMoscow says Ukraine must drop all ambitions to join Nato and withdraw all troops from provinces Russia says it has annexed since its invasion.

I won’t get into the details of that response today,” the National Security Council spokesperson said.\n\nThe US reaction came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused G-20 leaders of failing to act after Mr Putin’s nuclear rule change.\n\nUkraine is anxiously watching to see whether US President-elect Donald Trump will switch off American military aid and try to push through a peace deal that could force Kyiv to cede territory to Moscow.

        "full_content": "The US gave approval this week for Ukraine to use medium-range missiles against military targets inside Russia. PHOTO: AFP\n\n- Russia said on Nov 19 that Ukraine had fired US-supplied long-range missiles into its territory for the first time since Washington authorised such strikes as President Vladimir Putin issued a nuclear threat on the 1,000th day of the war.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official confirmed to AFP that its military had used Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles to strike inside Russian territory.\n\n“The attack on the Bryansk region was carried out by ATACMS missiles,” the source told AFP, without adding details. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky separately declined to comment during a press conference in Kyiv.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, speaking at a Group of 20 press conference in Brazil, said the strike marked a “new phase of the Western war” against Moscow, and vowed to react “accordingly”.\n\nThe grim 1,000th day anniversary opened with a Russian strike in the eastern Ukrainian region of Sumy that gutted a Soviet-era residential building and killed at least 12 people, including a child.\n\nMr Zelensky published images of rescuers hauling bodies from the debris and called on Kyiv’s allies to “force” the Kremlin into peace.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry released an anniversary statement calling on allies to ramp up military support to bring about a “sustainable” end to the war.\n\n“Ukraine will never submit to the occupiers, and the Russian military will be punished for violating international law,” the ministry said.\n\n“We need peace through strength, not appeasement,” it added, referring to growing calls for Kyiv to sit down at the negotiating table with Moscow to end the war.\n\nThe Kremlin also vowed to defeat Ukraine. “The military operation against Kyiv continues... and will be completed,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, using Russia’s preferred language for its invasion.\n\nNuclear sabre-rattling\n\nWashington this week said it had cleared Ukraine to use long-range ATACMS weapons against military targets inside Russia – a longstanding Ukrainian request.\n\nRussia’s military said: “At 3.25am (local time), the enemy struck a site in the Bryansk region with six ballistic missiles. According to confirmed data, US-made ATACMS tactical missiles were used.”\n\nMoscow has said the use of Western weapons against its internationally recognised territory would make the US a direct participant in the conflict and pledged an “appropriate and palpable response”.\n\nThe strike confirmation came shortly after Mr Putin signed a decree on Nov 19 which enables Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states such as Ukraine if they are supported by nuclear powers.\n\nThe new nuclear doctrine allows Moscow to unleash a nuclear response in the event of a “massive” air attack, even if it is only with conventional weapons.\n\nMr Peskov said this was “necessary to bring our principles in line with the current situation”.\n\nDeadly strike on Sumy\n\nRussia has stepped up strikes on Ukraine in recent days as its troops advance in the east of the country.\n\nOne overnight Russian attack hit a dormitory in the town of Glukhiv, which had a pre-war population of around 30,000 people and lies just 10km from the Kursk region in Russia, where Ukrainian troops captured territory in a major ground offensive in August.\n\nThe drone attack killed 12 people, including a child, the emergency services said.\n\nIn total, Kyiv said Russia had launched 87 drones over Ukraine during the night and that 51 were shot down.\n\nThe strike on Sumy comes just days after another Russian aerial bombardment in the border region killed 12 people and wounded 84. A separate missile strike on Nov 18 on Odesa in southern Ukraine left 10 dead and 55 wounded.\n\nUS President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to cut US assistance to Ukraine and bring about a swift end to the war, without detailing how he would do so.\n\nA group of European foreign ministers meeting in Warsaw on Nov 19 discussed stepping up aid to Ukraine if US support wanes.\n\n“I note with appreciation the readiness of the largest European Union countries to assume the burden of military and financial support for Ukraine in the context of a possible reduction in US involvement,” Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said after the talks.\n\nDirect threat to the West\n\nUkrainian forces have steadily lost ground in the Kursk region and have warned that Russia has amassed about 50,000 troops, including North Korean forces, to wrest back the region.\n\nThe anniversary of Russia’s invasion – launched on Feb 24, 2022 – comes at a perilous time for Ukrainian forces across the front, particularly near the war-battered cities of Kupiansk and Pokrovsk.\n\nNato chief Mark Rutte warned on Nov 19 that Mr Putin must not be allowed to prevail.\n\n“Why is this so crucial that Putin will not get his way? Because you will have an emboldened Russia on our border... and I’m absolutely convinced it will not stop there,” Mr Rutte said in Brussels.\n\n“It is then posing a direct threat to all of us in the West,” he said.\n\nThe EU’s outgoing top diplomat Josep Borrell also pressed member states to align with Washington in allowing Kyiv to strike inside Russia using donated long-range missiles. “It is fully in accordance with international law,” he said.

PHOTO: NYTIMES\n\nKremlin vows ‘response’ if Ukraine fires US missiles into Russia\n\n- The Kremlin on Nov 18 accused US President Joe Biden of escalating the 1,000-day-old war in Ukraine, promising a “palpable” response to any use of US long-range missiles by Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nMr Biden, who in January hands over the White House to Donald Trump, a sceptic of US support for Ukraine, called at a Group of 20 (G-20) summit – attended by Russia’s foreign minister – for support for Ukraine’s sovereignty.\n\nThe missile dispute raged as Moscow unleashed a second missile attack in two days on the Ukrainian Black Sea city of Odesa, killing 10 people and wounding 55, authorities said.\n\nUkraine’s Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga said the US decision to allow the use of Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) could be a “game changer”.\n\nKyiv has long sought authorisation to use ATACMS against military targets inside Russia as its troops face some of the most intense pressure since Russia launched its offensive in February 2022.\n\nRussia’s aerial bombardments have levelled entire districts near the front line and decimated energy facilities across Ukraine.\n\n“The longer Ukraine can strike, the shorter the war will be,” Mr Sybiga told reporters ahead of a UN Security Council meeting to mark 1,000 days since Russia’s full invasion.\n\n“It could have very positive impact on the situation on the battlefield.”\n\nBut Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said “it’s obvious that the outgoing administration in Washington intends... to continue fuelling the fire and provoke a further escalation of tensions”.\n\nSpeaking at the G-20 summit in Brazil, Mr Biden said: “The United States strongly supports Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Everyone around this table in my view should as well.”\n\nA US official told AFP the major policy shift on the missiles was in response to Russia’s deployment of thousands of North Korean troops in its campaign.\n\n‘Direct US involvement’\n\nMr Peskov said President Vladimir Putin had clearly expressed Moscow’s position in September when he declared that using the missiles would put Nato “at war” with Russia.\n\nMr Putin said then that if Ukraine attacked Russia with long-range missiles, Moscow would “take the appropriate decisions” – a point the foreign ministry echoed on Nov 18.\n\n“Kyiv’s use of long-range missiles to attack our territory would represent the direct involvement of the United States and its satellites in hostilities against Russia,” the ministry said in a statement, vowing an “appropriate and palpable” response.\n\nWashington’s decision comes amid growing concerns over reports North Korea has deployed upwards of 10,000 troops to Russia to be sent into combat against Ukraine.\n\nUS Principal Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer said Washington had been clear it would formulate a response to the Kremlin’s decision to deploy “a foreign country’s forces” in Russia.\n\nZelensky visits frontline\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky (centre) visiting the 25th Separate Airborne Brigade in Pokrovsk on Nov 18. PHOTO: AFP\n\nRussia, which has made rapid gains in Donetsk over recent weeks, claimed the capture of another village in the eastern region.\n\nThe Donetsk regional governor said three people had been killed and two wounded in Russian attacks on the towns of Siversk and Kostyantynivka.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said he visited two key frontline cities – Pokrovsk and Kupiansk.\n\nPokrovsk is an important Ukrainian garrison city in the Donetsk region that Russian forces have been targeting, while Russian troops briefly entered Kupiansk last week and remain close to the outskirts.\n\n“This is a tense area,” Mr Zelensky said at Pokrovsk, thanking Ukrainian forces for ensuring that the wider Donbas territory was not “completely occupied by Russia”.\n\nMr Biden’s decision to allow Ukraine to use US missiles to strike inside Russia could prompt European allies to also review their stance. Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer refused to be drawn on the issue at the G-20.\n\nA senior Ukrainian presidency official expressed frustration over the time taken to get approval, however, saying the decision was “needed a year ago”.\n\nThe international chemical weapons watchdog said meanwhile that it had found banned CS riot gas in shell and soil samples provided by Ukraine from the conflict zone.\n\nThe presence of the gas violated a convention on the use of toxic weapons.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have accused each other of using chemical weapons, while Britain and the United States also charge Moscow with using banned toxic agents against Ukrainian troops.\n\nUkrainian engineers meanwhile were still repairing damaged facilities from a Russian missile and drone barrage a day earlier.\n\nPrime Minister Denys Shmygal said around 220,000 consumers were without electricity in the Odesa and Dnipropetrovsk regions.

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry and president's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nRussia has warned that it would see a move to loosen the limits on Ukraine's use of US weapons as a major escalation.\n\nMr Vladimir Dzhabarov, first deputy head of the Russian Upper House’s international affairs committee, said Washington’s decision to let Kyiv strike deep into Russia could lead to “World War III”.\n\n“The West has decided on such a level of escalation that it could end with the Ukrainian statehood in complete ruins by morning,” Mr Andrei Klishas, a senior member of the Federation Council, Russia’s Upper Chamber of Parliament, said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nUkraine's first deep strikes are likely to be carried out using ATACMS rockets, which have a range of up to 306km, according to the sources.\n\nWhile some US officials have expressed scepticism that allowing long-range strikes will change the war's overall trajectory, the decision could help Ukraine at a moment when Russian forces are making gains and possibly put Kyiv in a better negotiating position when and if ceasefire talks happen.\n\nIt is not clear if Trump will reverse Mr Biden's decision when he takes office. Trump has long criticised the scale of US financial and military aid to Ukraine and has vowed to end the war quickly, without explaining how.\n\nA Trump spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But one of Trump's closest foreign policy advisers, Mr Richard Grenell, criticised the decision.\n\n\"Escalating the wars before he leaves office,\" Mr Grenell said, in an X post responding to the news.\n\nSome congressional Republicans had urged Mr Biden to loosen the rules on how Ukraine can use US-provided weapons.\n\nSince Trump's Nov 5 victory, senior Biden administration officials have repeatedly said they would use the remaining time to ensure Ukraine can fight effectively next year or negotiate peace with Russia from a \"position of strength\".\n\n‘Way too late’\n\nThe US believes more than 10,000 North Korean soldiers have been sent to eastern Russia and that most of them have moved to the Kursk region and have begun to engage in combat operations.\n\nRussia is advancing at its fastest rate since 2022 despite taking heavy losses, and Ukraine said it had clashed with some of those North Korean troops deployed to Kursk.\n\nStretched by personnel shortages, Ukrainian forces have lost some of the ground they captured in an August incursion into Kursk that Zelensky said could serve as a bargaining chip.\n\n\"Removing targeting restrictions will allow the Ukrainians to stop fighting with one hand tied behind their back,\" Mr Alex Plitsas, senior non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council, said.\n\n\"However, like everything else, I believe history will say the decision came way too late. Just like the ATACMS, Himars, Bradley Fighting Vehicles, Abrams Tanks and F-16. They were all needed much sooner,\" he added.\n\nDespite Mr Zelensky's pleas, the White House had been reluctant to allow US-supplied weapons to be used to strike targets deep inside Russia for fear this could escalate the conflict.\n\nRepublican US Representative Mike Turner, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that Mr Biden’s decision was long overdue and that there were still too many restrictions on Ukraine.\n\nBut he added: “This first step will put pressure on Vladimir Putin as President-elect Trump returns to the White House and works to end this war.”\n\nKyiv's other allies have been supplying weapons but with restrictions on how and when they can be used inside Russia, out of concern such strikes could prompt retaliation that draws Nato countries into the war or provokes a nuclear conflict.\n\nPolish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski also called the move a response to North Korea's involvement.\n\n\"President Biden responded to the entry of North Korean troops into the war and the massive Russian missile strike in a language that V.

We have to end it by diplomatic means,” Mr Zelensky said in an interview with Ukrainian radio. “And this, I think, is very important.”\n\nThere have been no meaningful talks between Russia and Ukraine, but a Trump presidency raises questions about the future of the conflict, with the Republican repeatedly saying he would end the war swiftly.\n\n“We have to understand what the Russians want,” Mr Zelensky said.\n\nReferring to Ukraine, he said: “You are at war with a state that does not value its people, that has a lot of equipment, that does not care how many people die.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said he will only accept talks with Ukraine if Kyiv surrenders Ukrainian territory that Moscow occupies.\n\nThe Kremlin said he repeated that demand in a phone conversation with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Nov 15.\n\nMr Zelensky has rejected Mr Putin’s conditions.\n\nMoscow has made steady advances in eastern Ukraine since this summer, inching closer to key hubs such as Pokrovsk and Kurakhove.\n\nMr Zelensky said on Nov 16 that Russian forces were suffering heavy losses and that the adance had “slowed down” in some areas.

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nSEOUL – North Korea has ratified a landmark defence pact with Russia, state media reported on Nov 12, deepening security cooperation that has seen Pyongyang send thousands of troops to help Moscow fight against Ukraine.\n\nThe agreement formalises months of tightening military bonds between two nations that were Communist allies throughout the Cold War.\n\nSeoul and ally the United States have accused the nuclear-armed North of sending thousands of soldiers to Russia, where they have been outfitted with Russian uniforms and are, according to reports, massed on the border near Kursk.\n\nThe deal “was ratified as a decree” of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said on Nov 12.\n\nThe notice comes after Russian lawmakers voted unanimously last week to ratify the deal, which President Vladimir Putin later signed.\n\n“The treaty will take effect from the day when both sides exchange the ratification instruments,” KCNA said.\n\nNorth Korea has become one of the most vocal and important backers of Russia’s full-scale offensive on Ukraine.\n\nPyongyang has long been accused by Western nations of supplying Moscow with artillery shells and missiles for use in Ukraine, but that support has escalated in recent weeks with the reported arrival of thousands of North Korean troops prepared to engage in combat.\n\nMr Putin and Mr Kim signed the strategic partnership treaty in June, during the Kremlin chief’s visit to Pyongyang.\n\nIt obligates both states to provide military assistance “without delay” in the case of an attack on the other, and to cooperate internationally to oppose Western sanctions.\n\nMr Putin hailed the deal in June as a “breakthrough document”.\n\n“With bilateral ratifications, Pyongyang and Moscow will claim legitimacy for North Korea’s military deployment to Russia, arguing that this action is justified by the ratified treaty between the two,” said Mr Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification.\n\n“While their treaty does not override UN resolutions prohibiting such cooperation, they will assert its legitimacy based on their agreement,” Mr Hong added.\n\n“This raises the prospect of additional, potentially larger deployments of North Korean manpower to Russia in the future.”\n\nNorth Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui recently visited Moscow and said her country would “stand firmly by our Russian comrades until victory day”.\n\nShe called Moscow’s offensive against Ukraine a “sacred struggle” and said Pyongyang believed in Mr Putin’s “wise leadership”.\n\nCiting intelligence reports, South Korea, Ukraine and the West say North Korea has deployed around 10,000 troops to Russia to fight against Ukraine.\n\nWhen asked publicly about the deployment in October , Mr Putin did not deny it, instead deflecting the question to criticise the West’s support of Ukraine.\n\nThe West fears Russia is offering North Korea technological support that could advance Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons programme, in exchange for sending troops.\n\nThe reclusive state recently fired a salvo of ballistic missiles, including a test of a new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile.
