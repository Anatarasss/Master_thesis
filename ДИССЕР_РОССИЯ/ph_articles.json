        "full_content": "ISTANBUL, Turkey – War rivals Ukraine and Russia are set to go into their first direct talks in more than three years on Thursday, with Russian President Vladimir Putin not included on the list of attendees.\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had challenged Putin to meet him in person in Istanbul, but the Russian delegation names only a lower-level team.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nPutin’s absence would diminish the importance of the first direct negotiations since a failed effort in the weeks after Russia’s 2022 invasion.\n\nTens of thousands have been killed since the offensive started in February 2022. Russia has occupied about a fifth of Ukraine’s territory in what is now Europe’s worst conflict since World War II.\n\nPutin had proposed holding talks on May 15 in Istanbul as a counter-offer after Ukraine and European nations last week called for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire.\n\nZelenskyy agreed, but said this week that if Putin did not attend himself, it would signal he was not genuinely interested in peace.\n\n“This is his war… Therefore, the negotiations should be with him,” Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe Kremlin delegation is set to be headed by Vladimir Medinsky, a hardline aide to Putin and ex-culture minister who was involved in the 2022 negotiations.\n\nPutin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov — who had all been rumored as top negotiators after leading previous talks with the United States — were not named in the Kremlin’s delegation list.\n\nMedinsky is seen as influential in advancing Russia’s historical claims over Ukrainian territory.\n\nThe other three negotiators were named as Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin, Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin and Igor Kostyukov, director of Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency.\n\nEuropean leaders have said new sanctions will be quickly imposed on Russia if the Istanbul talks do not produce results.\n\nOn the eve of the talks, Zelenskyy said he would decide Ukraine’s next “steps” based on who represents Moscow.\n\n“Ukraine is ready for any format of negotiations, and we are not afraid of meetings. Tomorrow – in Turkey,” Zelenskyy said. “I am waiting to see who will arrive from Russia. Then I will decide what steps Ukraine should take.”\n\nRussia insists the talks address what it calls the “root causes” of the conflict, including the “denazification” and demilitarisation of Ukraine, two vague terms Moscow has used to justify its invasion.\n\nIt has also repeated that Ukraine must cede territory occupied by Russian troops.\n\nKyiv said it will not recognize its territories as Russian — though Zelensky has acknowledged that Ukraine might only get them back through diplomatic means.\n\nUS Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, will be in Istanbul on Friday. Rubio met Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga at a NATO meeting in Turkey on Wednesday.\n\nAnd US President Donald Trump on Wednesday indicated he could take a mediation role in Turkey.\n\n“I don’t know that he (Putin) would be there if I’m not there,” Trump told reporters accompanying him on a Middle East tour.\n\n“I know he would like me to be there, and that’s a possibility. If we could end the war, I’d be thinking about that,” he said.\n\nUS President Donald Trump on Wednesday offered to go to Turkey if Putin also showed up.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected in Istanbul on Friday for part of the talks. Rubio met with Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga on Wednesday on the sidelines of a NATO foreign ministers’ meeting in Antalya, Turkey.\n\nSybiga said on X that he explained Zelenksyy’s “vision of further peace efforts” during “this critical week”.\n\n“We discussed in detail the logic of further steps and shared our approaches,” he added.\n\nMedinsky is seen as influential in advancing Russia’s historical claims over swathes of Ukraine and has written text-books advancing a nationalist view of Russian history that has been questioned by independent historians.\n\nThe other three negotiators were named as Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin, Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin and Igor Kostyukov, director of Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency.\n\nPutin last weekend proposed direct negotiations and had come under intense international pressure — including from some allies — to meet with Zelenskyy.\n\nTrump floated the idea of mediating if Putin attended.\n\n“I don’t know that he (Putin) would be there if I’m not there,” Trump told reporters while on his Middle East tour.\n\n“I know he would like me to be there, and that’s a possibility. If we could end the war, I’d be thinking about that,” he said.\n\nHe said he had a packed schedule but added: “That doesn’t mean I wouldn’t do it to save a lot of lives.”"

        "full_content": "PARIS – President Emmanuel Macron has said France did not want to unleash “World War III” over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and vowed referendums on key issues as he outlined his aims for for the remaining two years of his mandate in a marathon television appearance.\n\nMacron, who came to power in 2017 promising radical change, will step down in 2027 after serving the maximum two terms allowed under the Constitution.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMeanwhile, in Brussels, the EU Wednesday approved a fresh package of sanctions on Russia, clamping down on its “shadow” oil fleet, as Europe threatens further punishment if Moscow does not agree to a Ukraine truce.\n\nThe new measures against the Kremlin — the 17th round of sanctions from the EU since Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine — were in the pipeline before European leaders issued their latest ultimatum to Moscow over US-led peace efforts.\n\nDiplomats representing the EU’s 27 member states approved the package at a meeting in Brussels, according to the Polish presidency of the bloc.\n\nThe package — set to be formally adopted on Tuesday — includes blacklisting some 200 oil tankers used to circumvent curbs on Russian oil exports.\n\nCompanies in countries including Vietnam, Serbia and Turkey accused of helping supply goods to the Russian military are also set to face restrictions.\n\nOn occasion over the last year, Macron has appeared as a lame duck especially after his decision to hold snap legislative elections backfired, leaving the far-right as the biggest party in parliament and his own party a diminished, minority presence.\n\nBut recent months have seen a newly energized Macron, boosted by his presence on the international front as he seeks to bring an end to the three-year-war sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“We must help Ukraine defend itself but we do not want to unleash a Third World War,” Macron said in the interview that lasted more than three hours.\n\n“The war must cease and Ukraine must be in the best possible situation to go into negotiations,” he added.\n\nBut Macron said France was ready to start discussing with other European countries deploying French warplanes armed with nuclear weapons on their territory, as the United States does.\n\n“The Americans have the bombs on planes in Belgium, Germany, Italy, Turkey,” Macron said.\n\n“We are ready to open this discussion. I will define the framework in a very specific way in the weeks and months to come,” he said.\n\nThose who put their points of view in front of Macron ranged from the head of the hardline CGT union, Sophie Binet, to Tibo Inshape, a muscular and massively followed fitness influencer.\n\nAmid concern about some 600 jobs in France, Macron told Binet that the French operations of steelmaker ArcelorMittal would not be nationalized but vowed to save its two plants in the country.\n\nIn a key announcement, he said he favored holding several referendums on the same day for voters to decide on French social and economic “reforms”.\n\n“I want us to organize a series of consultations,” Macron said, adding that the votes would take place on one day in coming months and address “major” economic and social reforms.\n\nWhile he would not go into details, he was open to a suggestion by Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, who has proposed holding a referendum on a plan to reduce France’s debt.\n\nReferendums could also address social reforms such as access to social media for under-15s and assisted dying.\n\nHowever, Macron rejected the idea of putting immigration issues to a popular vote despite repeated requests from the right and far right.\n\nTackling delicate social issues, the French president spoke out against the wearing of religious symbols, such as the Islamic veil, in sports competitions, but he added that for non-competitive sports practice it was up to sports federations to decide.\n\nWhile Macron, 47, must step down in 2027 after serving two consecutive terms, he could in theory return in 2032, something no French leader has ever done before.\n\nBut he said at the end of the TV marathon he had not yet thought about his future after 2027 and was only thinking of France in his daily work.\n\n“When I’m done (with the current term), I’ll think about what’s next. Then I’ll be able to answer you. But today, I haven’t thought about it,” he said."

Russian President Vladimir Putin says Ukraine “bears responsibility.”\n\nThe following day, then US president Barack Obama said a missile fired from separatist-held territory was to blame and the rebels would not have been able to hit the airliner without Russian support.\n\nIn 2022 a Dutch court sentenced three men to life in prison over the downing, among them two Russians, but Russia refused to extradite them.\n\nRussia has consistently denied any involvement in the tragedy.\n\nThe governments of Australia and the Netherlands welcomed the UN agency’s decision Monday night.\n\n“This is a historic moment in the pursuit of truth, justice and accountability for the victims of the downing of Flight MH17, and their families and loved ones,” the Australian government said in a statement.\n\nIt called on the agency to “move swiftly to determine remedies” for Russia’s violation of international law.\n\n“We call upon Russia to finally face up to its responsibility for this horrific act of violence and make reparations for its egregious conduct, as required under international law,” the statement added.\n\nInternational investigators suspended their probe of the downing last year, saying there was not enough evidence to identify more suspects."

For context, always refer to the full article.\n\nElton John and David Furnish attend the Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Awards Viewing Party, to celebrate the 97th Oscars Academy Awards in West Hollywood, California, U.S., March 2, 2025.\n\nThe Elton John AIDS Foundation says it was 'devastated' by the decision, which it says would prevent it from providing lifesaving care to people living with HIV in Russia\n\nMOSCOW, Russia – Russia’s general prosecutor on Thursday, April 3, banned the activities of the Elton John AIDS Foundation, accusing it of taking a negative stance towards countries like Russia that protect “traditional spiritual and moral values.”\n\nThe prosecutor’s office said the ban applied specifically to two non-governmental organizations, one registered in the United States and the other in Britain and both called the Elton John AIDS Foundation. It officially designated them as “undesirable organizations.”\n\nThe foundation was set up by Elton John, the gay British singer and songwriter who in the past has given sell-out concerts in Russia and spoken out against what he has said is unacceptable discrimination against gay people by the Russian authorities.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has rejected such assertions. He has cast Russia as a bastion of “traditional values” locked in an existential struggle with a decadent West.\n\nThe Elton John AIDS Foundation said it was “devastated” by the decision, which it said would prevent it from providing lifesaving care to people living with HIV in Russia.\n\n“For more than two decades, we have worked in collaboration with federal and non-governmental partners in Russia to provide hundreds of thousands of people with vital HIV services, including testing, treatment, and care,” it said in a statement.\n\n“This work is urgent: in 2024, there were over 1.2 million people living with HIV in Russia, with over 430,000 not receiving treatment. Today’s decision…will undoubtedly endanger lives and disrupt critical HIV prevention efforts.”\n\nThe prosecutor’s office cast the foundation as a malign influence on Russian society on its official Telegram channel.\n\n“When a musician plays along with the promoters of democracy, you get propaganda. And if Elton John is at the piano, it is not just anti-Russian propaganda,” it said.\n\n“The NGOs actively participate in an information campaign orchestrated by the ‘collective West’ to discredit traditional values and escalate social tensions,” it added.\n\nIn a separate statement on its website, the prosecutor’s office complained about the foundation’s promotion of “non-traditional sexual relationships, Western family models, and gender reassignment”.\n\nWithout citing examples, the statement accused the foundation of taking part in what it called a Western campaign to “denigrate Russia” over its war in Ukraine, which the prosecutor called a “special military operation.”\n\nPutin has encouraged women to have at least three children to battle a birth rate dip in the country, and a 2022 law widened a ban on “LGBT propaganda” to effectively ban any public expressions regarding homosexuality.\n\nIn November, Russia’s lower house of parliament voted unanimously to ban what authorities cast as pernicious propaganda for a child-free way of life.\n\nIn a mission statement on its website, the Elton John AIDS Foundation said it had raised more than $600 million to support over 3,100 projects in 95 countries globally to increase access to health care, tackle LGBTQ+ stigma, and end AIDS. – Rappler.com"

Kyiv is sending its defence minister to the negotiations.\n\n“We are going with the mood to fight for the solution of at least one issue,” Karasin told Zvezda, which is owned by Russia’s defense ministry.\n\nHe said they were leaving for Saudi Arabia on Sunday and would return on Tuesday.\n\nRussia’s choice of negotiators for the talks has raised questions. Both are outside of traditional diplomatic decision-making institutions such as the Kremlin, foreign ministry or defense ministry.\n\nKarasin is a career diplomat who now sits in Russia’s upper house of parliament, while Beseda is a long-time FSB officer and now an advisor to the security service’s director.\n\nThe FSB in 2014 admitted that Beseda was in Kyiv during a bloody crackdown in the Ukrainian capital in the midst of the country’s pro-EU revolution.\n\nUkraine has accused Russia of not genuinely seeking peace and condemned its ongoing attacks, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin saying on Tuesday he had ordered his army to stop targeting Ukrainian energy sites.\n\nIn contrast, a US official close to Trump, White House envoy Steve Witkoff, has praised Putin — whom he met in Moscow last week — as a “great” leader seeking to end the conflict with Kyiv.\n\n“I thought he was straight up with me,” Witkoff told an American right-wing podcast host, Tucker Carlson, in an interview aired Friday.\n\n“I don’t regard Putin as a bad guy. That is a complicated situation, that war, and all the ingredients that led up to it,” Trump’s envoy said.\n\nRussia fired 179 drones at Ukraine in its latest overnight barrage, the Ukrainian air force said Saturday.\n\nIn the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, an entire family, including a 14-year-old girl, was killed when a drone crashed into their house Friday, the regional authorities said.\n\nAn AFP photographer at the scene of one strike saw rescue workers sifting through the rubble of a destroyed building, as smoke and fog hung in the night air.\n\nIn the eastern Donetsk region, Russian strikes on Saturday killed at least two people and wounded three, according to the local governor.\n\nUkraine also targeted Russia with drone attacks overnight, wounding two in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don."

        "full_content": "KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine and Russia agreed in principle to a limited ceasefire after President Donald Trump spoke with the countries' leaders this week, though it remains to be seen when it might take effect and what possible targets would be off limits to attack.\n\nThe tentative deal to partially rein in the grinding war came after Russian President Vladimir Putin rebuffed Trump’s push for a full 30-day ceasefire. The difficulty in getting the combatants to agree not to target one another's energy infrastructure highlights the challenges Trump will face in trying to fulfill his campaign pledge to quickly end to the war.\n\nAfter a roughly hourlong call with Trump on Wednesday that both leaders said went well, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters that “technical” talks in Saudi Arabia this weekend would seek to resolve what types of infrastructure would be protected under the agreement.\n\nBut it was immediately clear that the three parties had different views about what the pact entailed, with the White House saying “energy and infrastructure” would be covered, the Kremlin saying the agreement referred more narrowly to “energy infrastructure,” and Zelenskyy saying he'd also like railways and ports to be protected.\n\n“One of the first steps toward fully ending the war could be ending strikes on energy and other civilian infrastructure,” Zelenskyy said on social media following his call with Trump, which came a day after the U.S. president held similar talks with Putin. “I supported this step, and Ukraine confirmed that we are ready to implement it.”\n\nDuring their call, Trump suggested that Zelenskyy should consider giving the U.S. ownership of Ukraine's power plants to ensure their long-term security, according to a White House statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz.\n\nTrump told Zelenskyy that the U.S could be “very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise,\" the statement said.\n\nTrump suggested “American ownership of those plants could be the best protection for that infrastructure,” according to White House officials. The idea was floated even as the Trump administration looks to finalize an agreement to gain access to Ukraine's critical minerals as partial repayment for U.S. support for Ukraine during the war.\n\nZelenskyy, though, said the conversation focused on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant — which is the largest of its kind in Europe and has been under Russian control since early in the war. He said Trump posed the idea of “an understanding\" in which \"the United States can recover” the plant.\n\nThe call, which Zelenskyy described as “fruitful,” came just weeks after a disastrous Oval Office meeting between the two leaders that led to Trump temporarily pausing intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine.\n\nDuring the call, Zelenskyy requested additional Patriot defense missile systems. Rubio and Waltz said Trump “agreed to work with him to find what was available, particularly in Europe.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Putin told Trump that he would agree not to target Ukraine’s energy infrastructure but refused to back a full 30-day ceasefire that Trump proposed.\n\nAccording to the Kremlin, Putin made clear to Trump that there must be a cessation of foreign military aid and intelligence sharing as part of any deal. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday underscored that U.S. “intelligence sharing in terms of defense for Ukraine” would continue.\n\nThe Kremlin says Kyiv isn't upholding its end of the bargain\n\nPrior to his call with Trump, Zelenskyy said Putin’s limited ceasefire pledge was “very much at odds with reality” after Russia launched an overnight barrage of drone strikes across Ukraine, including some that struck Ukrainian energy facilities.\n\nRussia responded by saying it had halted its targeting of Ukraine's energy facilities and accused Kyiv of attacking Russian equipment near one of its pipelines.\n\n“Unfortunately, we see that for now there is no reciprocity on the part of the Kyiv regime,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nThe White House described Tuesday's call between Trump and Putin as the first step in a “movement to peace.\" But there was no indication that Putin is ready to back away from his conditions for a prospective peace deal, which are fiercely opposed by Kyiv.\n\nZelenskyy even while agreeing to work on the limited ceasefire said Putin is not seriously pursuing peace talks, and wants to prolong the war until he is in a stronger position.\n\nTechnical experts to gather soon in Saudi Arabia\n\nThe White House also confirmed that technical experts from the U.S., Ukraine and Russia would gather in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to discuss implementing the partial ceasefire.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the U.S. would meet together or separately with the Ukrainian and Russian officials. Waltz spoke with his Russian counterpart, Yuri Ushakov, on Wednesday to discuss the coming talks.\n\nUkraine and Russia trade accusations\n\nShortly after the call between Trump and Putin on Tuesday, air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv, followed by explosions as residents took shelter.\n\nDespite efforts to repel the attack, several strikes hit civilian infrastructure, including two hospitals, a railway and more than 20 houses, Zelenskyy said. Russian drones were reported over Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Chernihiv, Poltava, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, and Cherkasy regions.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said its military had launched seven drones at power facilities related to the military-industrial complex in Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv region, but that it shot them down after receiving Putin’s order to not hit energy infrastructure.\n\nMoscow accused Ukraine of targeting its energy facility in the Krasnodar region bordering the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014, several hours after the Putin and Trump talks. The ministry said three drones targeted oil transfer equipment that feeds the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, causing a fire and leading one oil tank to lose pressure.\n\n“It is absolutely clear that we are talking about yet another provocation deliberately concocted by the Kyiv regime, aimed at derailing the peace initiatives of the U.S. president,” the Russian Defense Ministry said.\n\nRussia said its air defenses intercepted 57 Ukrainian drones over the Azov Sea and several Russian regions — the border provinces of Kursk and Bryansk and the nearby regions of Oryol and Tula.\n\nZelenskyy said that “words of a ceasefire” weren't enough.\n\n“If the Russians don’t hit our facilities, we definitely won’t hit theirs,” Zelenskyy said.\n\nMeanwhile, the two combatants said Wednesday that they had each swapped 175 prisoners in one of the largest exchanges of the war.\n\nUkraine's red line\n\nZelenskyy rejected Putin’s key condition that Western allies stop providing military aid and intelligence to Ukraine. He said doing so would endanger lives if citizens were blind to incoming air raids and lead to the continuation of the war.\n\n“I don’t think anybody should make any concessions in terms of helping Ukraine, but rather, assistance to Ukraine should be increased,\" Zelenskyy said. \"This will be a signal that Ukraine is ready for any surprises from the Russians.”\n\nZelenskyy said one of the most difficult issues in future negotiations would be the issue of territorial concessions.\n\n“For us, the red line is the recognition of the Ukrainian temporarily occupied territories as Russian,\" he said. “We will not go for it.” (AP)"

US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters, watched by National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, aboard Air Force One on his return to Washington, DC, USA, March 16, 2025.\n\nUkraine's acceptance of a proposed ceasefire has now put the onus on Russia to cede to Trump's demands and will test the US president's more positive view of Putin\n\nWASHINGTON, USA – US President Donald Trump said he plans to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, March 18, and discuss ending the war in Ukraine, after positive talks between US and Russian officials in Moscow.\n\n“We want to see if we can bring that war to an end,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One during a flight back to the Washington area from Florida. “Maybe we can, maybe we can’t, but I think we have a very good chance.\n\n“I’ll be speaking to President Putin on Tuesday. A lot of work’s been done over the weekend.”\n\nTrump is trying to win Putin’s support for a 30-day ceasefire proposal that Ukraine accepted last week, as both sides continued trading heavy aerial strikes through the weekend and Russia moved closer to ejecting Ukrainian forces from their months-old foothold in the western Russian region of Kursk.\n\nWhen asked about what concessions are being considered in ceasefire negotiations, Trump said: “We’ll be talking about land. We’ll be talking about power plants…We’re already talking about that, dividing up certain assets.”\n\nTrump did not elaborate but was most likely referring to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia facility in Ukraine, Europe’s largest nuclear plant. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of risking an accident at the plant with their actions.\n\nThere was no immediate response from the Kremlin to a request for comment from Reuters.\n\nThe Kremlin said on Friday that Putin had sent Trump a message about his ceasefire plan via US envoy Steve Witkoff, who held talks in Moscow, expressing “cautious optimism” that a deal could be reached to end the three-year conflict.\n\nIn separate appearances on Sunday TV shows in the United States, Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, emphasized that there were still challenges to be worked out before Russia agrees to a ceasefire, much less a final peaceful resolution to the war.\n\nAsked on ABC whether the US would accept a peace deal in which Russia was allowed to keep stretches of eastern Ukraine that it has seized, Waltz replied, “Are we going to drive every Russian off of every inch of Ukrainian soil?” He added that the negotiations had to be grounded in “reality.”\n\nRubio told CBS a final peace deal would involve “concessions from both Russia and Ukraine,” and that it would be difficult to even begin those negotiations “as long as they’re shooting at each other”.\n\nAn overnight Ukrainian drone attack targeted energy facilities in Russia’s southern Astrakhan region, injuring one person and sparking a fire, the regional governor said. Kyiv’s mayor said on Monday Russia had carried out an overnight drone attack on the Ukrainian capital.\n\n‘Ironclad’ guarantees\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Friday that he saw a good chance to end the Russian war after Kyiv accepted the US proposal for a 30-day interim ceasefire.\n\nHowever, Zelenskyy has consistently said the sovereignty of his country is not negotiable and that Russia must surrender the territory it has seized. Russia seized the Crimea peninsula in 2014 and now controls most of four eastern Ukrainian regions since it invaded the country in 2022.\n\nRussia will seek “ironclad” guarantees in any peace deal that NATO nations exclude Kyiv from membership and that Ukraine will remain neutral, a Russian deputy foreign minister said in remarks published on Monday.\n\nIn an interview with the Russian media outlet Izvestia that made no reference to the ceasefire proposal, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said that any long-lasting peace treaty on Ukraine must meet Moscow’s demands.\n\n“We will demand that ironclad security guarantees become part of this agreement,” Izvestia cited Grushko as saying.\n\n“Part of these guarantees should be the neutral status of Ukraine, the refusal of NATO countries to accept it into the alliance.”\n\nPutin has said his military incursion into Ukraine was because NATO’s creeping expansion threatened Russia’s security. He has demanded that Ukraine drop its NATO ambitions, that Russia keeps control of all Ukrainian territory seized, and that the size of the Ukrainian army be limited. He also wants Western sanctions eased and a presidential election in Ukraine, which Kyiv says is premature while martial law is in force.\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said on Monday that the conditions demanded by Russia to agree to a ceasefire showed that Moscow does not really want peace.\n\nPeacekeepers\n\nTrump, who has upended US policy by shifting closer to Moscow, berated Zelenskyy in a meeting in Washington last month that ended with the Ukrainian leader leaving the White House early.\n\nBut Ukraine’s acceptance of a proposed ceasefire has now put the onus on Russia to cede to Trump’s demands and will test the US president’s more positive view of Putin.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Saturday that Western allies other than the US were stepping up preparations to support Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire with Russia, with defense chiefs set to firm up “robust plans” next week.\n\nBritain and France both have said that they are willing to send a peacekeeping force to monitor any ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has ruled out peacekeepers until the war has ended.\n\n“If they appear there, it means that they are deployed in the conflict zone with all the consequences for these contingents as parties to the conflict,” Russia’s Grushko said.\n\n“We can talk about unarmed observers, a civilian mission that would monitor the implementation of individual aspects of this agreement, or guarantee mechanisms. In the meantime, it’s just hot air.” – Rappler.com"

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz speak with the media following meetings with a Ukrainian delegation in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, March 11, 2025. In the Saudi-hosted talks, Ukraine is to present the US with a plan for a partial ceasefire with Russia, hoping to restore support from its key benefactor, which under President Donald Trump has demanded concessions to end the three-year war.\n\nRussia awaits the US ceasefire proposal details amid shifting dynamics in the Ukraine conflict as Trump pushes for negotiations\n\nMOSCOW, Russia – The Kremlin said on Wednesday, March 13, it was awaiting details from Washington about a proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, while senior Moscow sources said a deal would have to take account of Russia’s advances and address its concerns.\n\nAfter Russian forces made gains in 2024, US President Donald Trump reversed US policy on the war, launching bilateral talks with Moscow and suspending military assistance to Ukraine, demanding that it take steps to end the conflict.\n\nThe United States agreed on Tuesday to resume weapons supplies and intelligence sharing after Kyiv said at talks in Saudi Arabia that it was ready to support a ceasefire proposal.\n\nThe Kremlin said it was carefully studying the results of the meeting and would await details from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov suggested a reporter was getting “a little ahead” of himself by asking if Russia intended to tie a ceasefire proposal to the lifting of international sanctions imposed over the war in Ukraine.\n\n“Rubio and Waltz said that they would pass on detailed information to us through various channels about the essence of the conversation that took place in Jeddah. First, we must receive this information,” Peskov said.\n\nRubio said the United States was hoping for a positive response, and that if the answer was “no” then it would tell Washington a lot about the Kremlin’s true intentions.\n\nHe said there would be contacts with Moscow on Wednesday, that Europe would have to be involved in any security guarantee for Ukraine, and that the sanctions Europe has imposed would also be on the table.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 has left hundreds of thousands of dead and injured, displaced millions of people, reduced towns to rubble and triggered the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West in six decades.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has repeatedly said that he is ready to talk about an end to the war and Trump says he thinks Putin is serious, though other Western leaders disagree.\n\nTrump said on Tuesday that he hoped Russia would agree to a ceasefire and that he would talk to Putin this week.\n\nReuters reported in November that Putin was ready to negotiate a deal with Trump, but would refuse to make major territorial concessions and would insist Kyiv abandon ambitions to join NATO. – Rappler.com"

For context, always refer to the full article.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio says the US would now take the offer to Russia, and the ball is in Moscow's court\n\nJEDDAH, Saudi Arabia – The United States agreed on Tuesday, March 11, to resume military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine after talks where Kyiv said it would accept a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in its conflict with Russia, the countries said in a joint statement.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US would now take the offer to Russia, and the ball is in Moscow’s court.\n\n“Our hope is that the Russians will answer ‘yes’ as quickly as possible, so we can get to the second phase of this, which is real negotiations,” Rubio told reporters, referring to US President Donald Trump, after more than eight hours of talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Kremlin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago, and Russia, which has been making advances, now holds around a fifth of Ukraine’s territory, including Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.\n\nRubio said Washington wanted a full agreement with both Russia and Ukraine “as soon as possible.”\n\n“Every day that goes by, this war continues, people die, people are bombed, people are hurt on both sides of this conflict,” he said.\n\nHow Moscow would respond was far from certain.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said he is open to discussing a peace deal, but he and his diplomats have repeatedly stated they are against a ceasefire and would seek a deal that safeguards Russia’s “long-term security.” Putin has ruled out territorial concessions and said Ukraine must withdraw fully from four Ukrainian regions claimed and partly controlled by Russia.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russia’s foreign ministry said only that it did not rule out contacts with US representatives.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was in Saudi Arabia but did not participate in the talks, said the ceasefire was a “positive proposal,” that covers the frontline in the conflict, not just fighting by air and sea.\n\nWill Russia agree?\n\nThe Ukrainian leader said the ceasefire would take effect as soon as Russia agreed.\n\n“When the agreements come into force, during these 30 days of ‘silence,’ we will have time to prepare with our partners at the level of working documents all the aspects for reliable peace and long-term security,” Zelenskyy said.\n\nRubio said the plan would be delivered to the Russians through multiple channels. Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, was due to meet his Russian counterpart in the coming days and Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff plans to visit Moscow this week to meet Putin.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump said he hoped for a swift ceasefire and thought he would talk to Putin this week. “I hope it’ll be over the next few days,” he told reporters at a White House event to promote his close adviser Elon Musk’s Tesla car company.\n\nThe US-Ukraine agreement was a sharp turnaround from an acrimonious White House meeting on February 28 between the new Republican US president, who has long been a Ukraine aid skeptic, and Zelenskyy.\n\nIn Tuesday’s joint statement, the two countries said they agreed to conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine’s critical mineral resources, which had been in the works and was thrown into limbo by that meeting.\n\nFollowing that encounter, the United States cut off intelligence sharing and weapons shipments to Ukraine, underlining Trump’s willingness to pressure a US ally as he pivots to a more conciliatory approach to Moscow.\n\nTrump said on Tuesday he would invite Zelenskyy back to the White House.\n\nUkrainian officials said late on Tuesday that both US military assistance and intelligence sharing had resumed.\n\nEuropean partners\n\nA top aide to Zelenskyy said options for security guarantees to Ukraine were discussed with U.S. officials. Security guarantees have been one of Kyiv’s key aims, and some European countries have expressed willingness to explore sending peacekeepers.\n\nIn the joint statement, Ukraine reiterated that European partners should be involved in the peace process. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte will be at the White House on Thursday.\n\n“It seems like the Americans and Ukrainians have taken an important step towards peace. And Europe stands ready to help reach a just and lasting peace,” Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on X.\n\nWaltz said the initial resumption of military assistance for Ukraine would involve equipment from US stockpiles approved by former US President Joe Biden and stopped by Trump.\n\nAs the diplomacy plays out, Ukraine’s battlefield positions have been under heavy pressure, particularly in Russia’s Kursk region where Moscow’s forces have launched a push to flush out Kyiv’s troops, which had been trying to hold a patch of land as a bargaining chip.\n\nUkraine overnight launched its biggest drone attack on Moscow and the surrounding region yet, showing Kyiv can also land major blows after a steady stream of Russian missile and drone attacks, one of which killed 14 people on Saturday.\n\nThe attack, in which 337 drones were downed over Russia, killed at least three employees of a meat warehouse and caused a short shutdown at Moscow’s four airports. – Rappler.com"

Rubio and Waltz met last month, also in Saudi Arabia, with counterparts from Russia, ending a freeze in high-level contacts imposed by former president Joe Biden after Russia defied Western warnings and launched its invasion.\n\nTrump last week also threatened further sanctions against Russia to force it to the table as it carried out strikes on Ukraine.\n\nBut Trump’s abrupt shift in US policy has stunned many allies. Rubio said the United States was objecting to “antagonistic” language on Russia at a gathering of Group of Seven foreign ministers later this week in Canada.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called the scene from the White House “unspeakable” and described a “new age of infamy” that will require Europeans to shoulder more responsibility.\n\nFrench senator Claude Malhuret, in a speech that went viral in the United States even in translation, said that Trump had failed to see through Kremlin propaganda and that Russia was failing in Ukraine, picking up only small pockets of land after three years attacking a smaller country.\n\n“The American lifeline to Putin is the biggest strategic mistake ever made during a war,” he said."

In this file photo, Russia's Deputy head of the Security Council Dmitry Medvedev, accompanied by Deputy Defence Minister Nikolay Pankov, visits the Prudboi military training ground in Volgograd region, Russia June 1, 2023.\n\nRussian officials rebuke the claims of French President Emmanuel Macron of a Russian threat to Europe, warning that such rhetoric could escalate tensions and lead to a new world war amid ongoing conflict in Ukraine\n\nMOSCOW, Russia – Russian officials and lawmakers on Thursday, March 6, poured scorn on French President Emmanuel Macron for saying that Russia threatened Europe, and cautioned that such talk could lead the West towards the abyss of a new world war.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered the biggest confrontation between the West and Russia since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, and both the Kremlin and the White House have cautioned against missteps that could trigger World War Three.\n\nBut the advance of Russian forces in Ukraine in 2024 and US President Donald Trump’s upending of US policy towards Ukraine and Russia and demand for a peace deal to end the war have triggered a crisis among European powers who fear the United States is turning its back on Europe.\n\nMacron said in an address to the nation on Wednesday that Russia was “a threat for France and Europe”, that the Ukraine was already a “global conflict” and that he would open a debate about extending the French nuclear umbrella to allies in Europe.\n\n“Such an erroneous analysis leads to fatal errors,” said Konstantin Kosachev, a senior Russian senator, who said Macron had mistaken Russia’s reaction to the enlargement and aggression of the US-led military alliance towards Russia.\n\n“Macron maniacally imposes on his citizens, allies and the entire world a completely false concept of what is happening — ‘the Russians are coming!’ Such false conclusions and false suggestions lead to the abyss.”\n\nRussia and the United States are by far the world’s biggest nuclear powers, with over 5,000 nuclear warheads each, followed by China with about 500 and then France with 290 and the United Kingdom with 225, according to the Federation of American\n\nFormer Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, who once presented himself as a moderniser and now tries to outhawk the Kremlin’s most ardent hawks, said “Micron” posed no threat at all and predicted he would lose power by 2027.\n\nWar\n\nRussian officials say the tough rhetoric from Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other European powers over recent days is simply not backed up by hard military power and point to Russia’s advance on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin last year ordered the regular size of the Russian army to be increased by 180,000 troops to 1.5 million active servicemen in a move that would make it the second largest in the world after China’s.\n\nMaria Zakharova, spokeswoman for Russia’s foreign ministry, mocked Macron’s remarks that France had the most effective army in Europe suggesting that he should perhaps engage in a measurement exercise of some sort.\n\nSergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, said Macron had slandered Russia with lies and military propaganda.\n\nPutin has repeatedly dismissed as nonsense Western claims that Russia could one day attack a NATO member, which under the NATO charter would be considered an attack on all 32 members of the alliance.\n\nUkraine and the West say Putin is engaged in an imperial-style land grab in Ukraine, and have repeatedly vowed to defeat Russia, which currently controls just under 20% of Ukraine, including Crimea, and a chunk of eastern and southern Ukraine.\n\nPutin casts the war as part of a historic struggle with the West, which he says humiliated Russia after the Soviet Union fell in 1991 by enlarging NATO and encroaching on what he considers Moscow’s sphere of influence, including Ukraine.\n\nKosachev said that Macron was moving away from the legacy of former president Charles de Gaulle and said Macron was clearly seeking to shift the blame for all France and Europe’s problems solely on Russia’s shoulders. – Rappler.com"

Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shake hands during a bilateral meeting at 10 Downing Street ahead of a summit of European leaders, on March 1, 2025 in London, Britain.\n\nEurope is scrambling to ensure that Kyiv is not squeezed out of any talks after Trump's shouting match with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office raised fears that the US could pull support for Ukraine and impose a peace plan negotiated with Russia\n\nLONDON, United Kingdom – British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Sunday European leaders had agreed to draw up a Ukraine peace plan to take to the United States, a vital step for Washington to be able to offer security guarantees Kyiv says are vital to deter Russia.\n\nPlay Video\n\nAt a summit in London just two days after Volodymyr Zelenskyy clashed with US President Donald Trump and cut short a visit to Washington, world leaders offered a strong show of support to the Ukrainian president and promised to do more to help his nation.\n\nEuropean leaders agreed they must spend more on defence to show Trump the continent can protect itself. And the European Commission chief, with many EU nations struggling with already stretched public finances, suggested the bloc could ease its rules that limit debt levels.\n\nStarmer, who welcomed a visibly shaken Zelenskyy on Saturday with a warm hug, said Britain, Ukraine, France and some other nations would form a “coalition of the willing” and draw up a peace plan to take to Trump. He did not name other nations, but said more countries were willing to join.\n\n“We are at a crossroads in history today,” Starmer said. “This is not a moment for more talk. It’s time to act. Time to step up and lead and to unite around a new plan for a just and enduring peace.”\n\nZelenskyy said after the summit that European unity was “at an extremely high level not seen for a long time.”\n\n“We are all working together in Europe in order to find a basis for cooperation with America for a true peace and guaranteed security,” Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram.\n\nEurope is scrambling to ensure that Kyiv is not squeezed out of any talks after Trump’s shouting match with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office raised fears that the US could pull support for Ukraine and impose a peace plan negotiated with Russia.\n\nSeveral leaders said they must increase defence spending — something that could help bring Trump on side to offer a US security guarantee in the event of peace.\n\n“After a long time of underinvestment, it is now of utmost importance to step up the defence investment for a prolonged period of time,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the EU’s executive body, told reporters.\n\n“Member states need more fiscal space to do a surge in defence spending,” she said, adding that Europe needed to turn “Ukraine into a steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders”.\n\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said leaders agreed Europe needed to take on more responsibility and start bearing the burden of “more spending on its defence budgets within NATO”.\n\nHe added the leaders all agreed they must keep close ties with the US.\n\nLacking weaponry, stocks\n\nEurope, which lacks the weaponry and depth of ammunition stocks of the US, hopes to convince Trump that it can defend itself but that Russia will only adhere to a peace deal if it comes with the backing of the United States.\n\nTalks with the US have centred on Washington providing a so-called backstop for a European peacekeeping role, possibly in the form of air cover, intelligence and surveillance and a greater but unspecified threat if Russian President Vladmir Putin again sought to take more territory\n\nCrucial to getting any agreement from Trump is for European nations to increase defence spending and signal they would take part in any peacekeeping role — something Starmer acknowledged was difficult to get unanimity on.\n\nStarmer increased the UK’s defence spending before his visit to Washington last week, and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said some European leaders had privately set out new plans on defence spending at the meeting but he declined to give details.\n\n‘Uncomfortable viewing’\n\nTrump has upended US policy on the three-year-old war since he returned to the White House in January, casting doubt on U.S. military and political support for Ukraine — and Europe — and ending the isolation of Moscow.\n\nTrump had blindsided Europe by calling Putin without warning and sending a delegation to Saudi Arabia for talks with Russia without including Ukraine or Europe. Trump has falsely suggested that Kyiv was responsible for starting the war, and on Friday, he criticised Zelenskyy for not being grateful for US aid.\n\nZelenskyy’s clash with Trump on Friday ended a week when Europe had appeared to be in a better position in its drive to encourage Trump to continue to offer support to Ukraine after cordial visits to Washington by French President Emmanuel Macron and Starmer.\n\nStarmer described watching the spat between Zelenskyy and Trump in the Oval Office as uncomfortable viewing, but was keen to push the conversation forward by offering himself as a go-between for Europe and the United States.\n\nIn a further show of support for the Ukrainian leader, Zelenskyy later on Sunday flew to meet King Charles at his private residence in eastern England.\n\nThe Trump administration on Sunday continued to criticise Zelenskyy. White House national security adviser Mike Waltz told CNN that the US needs a Ukranian leader who is willing to secure a lasting peace with Russia, but that it is not clear Zelenskyy is prepared to do so.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov praised Trump’s “common sense” approach and accused European countries of seeking to prolong the conflict by propping up Zelenskyy “with their bayonets in the form of peacekeeping units”.\n\nStarmer said the leaders on Sunday also agreed to work to ensure Kyiv is at the table of any peace talks and boost the country’s own defence capabilities.\n\n“Europe must do the heavy lifting, but to support peace in our continent and to succeed, this effort must have strong US backing,” Starmer told a news conference. – Rappler.com"

That is the people of the United Kingdom coming out to demonstrate how much they support you…and our absolute determination to stand with you,” Starmer told him.\n\nStarmer told Zelenskyy he had “full backing across the United Kingdom.”\n\n“We stand with you and Ukraine for as long as it may take,” Starmer said.\n\nZelenskyy said on Saturday he had “important and warm” talks with Starmer, with a discussion on strengthening Ukraine’s position and obtaining reliable security guarantees.\n\n“During our talks we discussed the challenges standing before Ukraine and all of Europe, coordination with our partners, concrete steps to strengthen Ukraine’s position and ending the war in a just fashion, with reliable security guarantees,” Zelenskyy wrote on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nOther European leaders also issued messages of support for Zelenskyy and Ukraine after his meeting with Trump, highlighting differences between traditional allies the United States and Europe over the war since Trump returned to office.\n\nSenior Russian politicians have reacted with glee to what they see as Zelenskyy’s White House humiliation, saying the Ukrainian leader got what he deserved and that US military aid to Kyiv must now be cut.\n\nMacron: ‘Everybody needs to calm down’\n\nThe French presidency said Macron had also spoken to British Starmer, European Council President Antonio Costa, and NATO chief Mark Rutte, on the eve of the London summit.\n\n“I think that beyond the frayed nerves, everybody needs to calm down, show respect and gratitude, so we can move forward concretely, because what’s at stake is too important,” Macron said in an interview with several Sunday newspapers.\n\nMacron said Zelenskyy had told him he was willing to “restore dialogue” with the United States, including on a deal giving the US access to revenues from Ukraine’s natural resources, but did not say what Trump told him in the call.\n\nThe White House had no immediate comment.\n\nIn an interview with CNN on Friday, Trump’s Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on Zelenskyy to “apologize for turning this thing into the fiasco for him that it became.”\n\nIn an interview with Fox News on Friday Zelenskyy said he believed his relationship with Trump could be salvaged and appeared to express some regret, saying “I’m sorry for this.”\n\nThe falling-out meant that Ukraine and the United States failed to sign a much-vaunted minerals deal Kyiv hoped would spur Trump to back Ukraine’s war effort and potentially win support from Republicans in Congress for a new round of aid.\n\nTrump is not interested in revisiting the minerals deal at the moment, a senior White House official told Reuters on Friday evening.\n\nStarmer spoke to both Trump and Zelenskyy on Friday, and French President Emmanuel Macron also visited Trump in Washington this week.\n\nZelenskyy is also due to meet King Charles on Sunday. Britain’s Sun newspaper said the meeting would take place at the monarch’s Sandringham estate in eastern England.\n\n“I’m very happy that His Majesty the King accepted my meeting tomorrow,” Zelenskyy told Starmer at the start of their meeting.\n\nBritain has been a vocal backer of Ukraine and Charles has previously expressed his support for Zelenskyy, speaking of the “determination and strength” of the Ukrainian people in the face of an unprovoked attack from Russia.\n\nDuring Starmer’s visit to the White House, he presented Trump with a written invitation from the King for a state visit, which would make the US president the first elected political leader in modern times to be hosted for two state visits by a British monarch. – Rappler.com"

The UN must stop the killing. We urge all Member States to join us in returning the UN to its core mission of international peace and security,” said Washington’s envoy to the UN, Dorothy Shea, ahead of the votes.\n\nShe later hailed the Security Council’s passage of “an historic landmark agreement on Ukraine.”\n\n“We call on all other UN member states to join the United States in pushing for a durable peace that will bring stability to Europe and deter further aggression,” said Shea.\n\nUN chief Antonio Guterres on Sunday called for a peace that “fully upholds Ukraine’s territorial integrity” and respects the UN Charter."

You could have made a deal.”\n\nTrump also suggested he could meet Russian President Vladimir Putin before the end of the month in Saudi Arabia as he overhauls Washington’s stance towards Moscow — a shift that has alarmed European leaders.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Russia and the United States had agreed to establish teams to negotiate a path to ending the war in Ukraine after talks that drew a strong rebuke from Kyiv, with Zelenskyy postponing his own trip to Saudi Arabia.\n\nFrance’s Macron announced another meeting in Paris on Ukraine after the US-Russia talks, adding that Trump “can restart a useful dialogue” with Putin.\n\nTrump also increased pressure on Zelenskyy to hold elections — echoing one of Moscow’s key demands.\n\nAsked whether the United States would support demands that Russia wanted to force Zelenskyy to hold new elections as part of any deal, Trump began by criticizing what he said were the Ukrainian’s approval ratings.\n\n“They want a seat at the table, but you could say… wouldn’t the people of Ukraine have a say? It’s been a long time since we’ve had an election,” said Trump.\n\n“That’s not a Russian thing, that’s something coming from me, from other countries.”\n\nZelenskyy was elected in 2019 for a five-year term, but has remained in office as Ukraine is still under martial law.\n\nTrump’s latest remarks are unlikely to allay fears among some European leaders, already worried that Washington will make serious concessions to Moscow and re-write the continent’s security arrangement in a Cold War-style deal.\n\nWashington noted European nations would have to have a seat at the negotiating table “at some point”.\n\nThe US-Russia talks — the first high-level official talks between the two countries since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine — drew a fiery response from Kyiv.\n\n“This will only be feeding Putin’s appetite,” a Ukrainian senior official requesting anonymity told AFP, referring to the launch of talks without Ukraine.\n\nTrump for his part said he was “much more confident” of a deal after the Riyadh talks, telling reporters Tuesday at his Mar-a-Lago estate: “I think I have the power to end this war.”\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov agreed to “appoint respective high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible”, the State Department said.\n\nWashington added that the sides had also agreed to “establish a consultation mechanism” to address “irritants” to the US-Russia relationship, noting the sides would lay the groundwork for future cooperation.\n\nRiyadh marks a diplomatic coup for Moscow, which had been isolated for three years under the previous US administration of Joe Biden.\n\nMoscow’s economic negotiator, Kirill Dmitriev, said Western attempts to isolate Russia had “obviously failed”.\n\n“We did not just listen but heard each other, and I have reason to believe the American side has better understood our position,” Lavrov told reporters.\n\nThe veteran diplomat noted that Russia opposed any deployment of NATO-nation troops to Ukraine as part of an eventual ceasefire.\n\nEuropean allies publicly diverged this week over whether they would be open to sending truce peacekeepers to Ukraine.\n\nMacron, in an interview with French regional newspapers, appeared open to the idea of sending troops to Ukraine but only in the most limited fashion and away from conflict zones.\n\nHe said new talks would take place “with several European and non-European states”, after an emergency meeting on Monday in Paris which brought together a small number of key European countries.\n\nMoscow has long called for the withdrawal of NATO forces from eastern Europe, viewing the alliance as an existential threat on its flank.\n\nThe Kremlin on Tuesday said Ukraine had the right to join the European Union, but not the NATO military alliance.\n\nIt also said Putin was “ready” to negotiate with Zelenskyy “if necessary.”"

US President Donald Trump and released American schoolteacher Marc Fogel react during an event to welcome back Fogel, who had been held in Russia since 2021, at the White House in Washington, DC, USA, February 11, 2025.\n\nThe release of 63-year-old Marc Fogel comes as US President Donald Trump seeks to improve relations with Moscow as part of an effort to secure an end to the war in Ukraine\n\nWASHINGTON, USA – American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, freed by Russia after three and a half years in prison, got a flag-waving welcome from US President Donald Trump at a snowy White House on Tuesday, February 11, after a flight home from Moscow.\n\n“I feel like the luckiest man on earth right now,” said Fogel, an American flag draped around his shoulders. “I’m a middle-class school teacher who’s now in a dream world.”\n\nTrump, standing alongside Fogel in the White House Diplomatic Reception Room, said: “To me he looks damned good.”\n\nThe release of 63-year-old Fogel, who had been detained in Russia since August 2021 and was serving a 14-year sentence, came as Trump seeks to improve relations with Moscow as part of an effort to secure an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nTrump said Fogel’s release “could be a big important part” of ending the Ukraine war. He and Fogel both thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for his release.\n\n“We just wanted to get him back home,” Trump said, adding that he would take Fogel on a tour of the Lincoln Bedroom upstairs in the White House.\n\nTrump said another person would be released on Wednesday, without identifying who it would be. He called the terms of Fogel’s release “very fair.”\n\nFogel was released into the custody of Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, who made an unannounced stop in Moscow on Tuesday to pick him up.\n\nOn a plane home, Fogel, who is from Pennsylvania, was shown with a raised glass, a cheese plate and his US passport in a photo posted on social media by Trump’s chief hostage envoy Adam Boehler.\n\nAsked what the United States gave up in exchange for Fogel, Trump told reporters earlier: “Not much” and called the release a show of good faith from the Russians.\n\n“We were treated very nicely by Russia. Actually, I hope that’s the beginning of a relationship where we can end that (Ukraine) war and millions of people can stop being killed,” Trump said.\n\nFogel was sentenced to 14 years in prison for drug smuggling after he was detained in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport in August 2021 with 17 grams of marijuana in his luggage. The marijuana had been medically prescribed in Pennsylvania, where it is legal, said Martin De Luca, a member of Fogel’s legal team.\n\nWitkoff’s plane was on the ground in Moscow for a few hours before leaving with Fogel onboard, flying through central Europe and back to Washington, De Luca told Reuters.\n\n“We are beyond grateful, relieved, and overwhelmed that after more than three years of detention, our father, husband, and son, Marc Fogel, is finally coming home,” the Fogel family said in a statement. “This has been the darkest and most painful period of our lives, but today, we begin to heal.”\n\nDmitry Ovsyannikov, who had served as Fogel’s Russian lawyer in the past,told Russia’s Interfax news agency that Fogel was last week transferred from a prison in Rybinsk, north of Moscow, to a pre-trial detention center in Moscow ahead of his release.\n\nFogel was left out of a historic swap of prisoners in August that involved 24 prisoners — 16 sent from Russia to the West, including Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, and eight sent back to Russia from the West. – Rappler.com"

If there is no logistics, there is no infantry, because there is no way to supply it,” said the deputy commander of the Da Vinci Wolves battalion, known by the call sign Afer.\n\n“(Russians) have learned this and are doing it quite well.” / AP"

Both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.”\n\nBut Zelenskyy appeared sanguine about Trump’s return.\n\n“I have no doubt that the new American President is willing and capable of achieving peace and ending (Russian President Vladimir) Putin’s aggression,” Zelenskyy said.\n\nIn his own New Year’s Eve address on Tuesday, Putin did not explicitly mention the war in Ukraine but praised Russia’s soldiers for their “courage and bravery”.\n\n“You are true heroes who have undertaken the great military labour to defend Russia,” he said.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov paid tribute to “fallen soldiers” in his address, saying that they had died fighting “Nazism” — a pretext Putin used to launch his invasion.\n\nSince that began in February 2022, Moscow has launched overnight aerial attacks on Ukraine almost every day.\n\nThose have targeted military and civilian infrastructure, including the power grid.\n\nUkraine has stepped up its own attacks inside Russian territory in response, and urged its Western allies to supply more air defence systems.\n\nA Ukrainian drone strike in western Russia caused a fuel spill and fire at an oil depot, a Russian regional governor said earlier on Tuesday.\n\nZelenskyy has urged his war-battered country’s allies to help end the invasion and bring lasting peace in 2025.\n\nThose hopes were echoed to AFP on the streets of Kyiv ahead of the turn of the new year.\n\n“I want peace to finally be obtained for Ukraine, for people to stop dying, for all our soldiers to return to their homes and celebrate next year and next Christmas with their families,” said Kateryna Chemeryz, a teacher.\n\n“It seems to me that everyone has one wish, one dream: that Ukraine will win, and all our territories are regained,” said Tetiana, a civil servant who declined to give her family name.\n\nThe incoming US president has vowed to end the war but has not outlined any roadmap and there are concerns a deal could come at the expense of Ukrainian territory.\n\nZelensky has sought to build bridges with Trump and his team, amid fears the Republican could slow vital US military aid or halt it entirely.\n\n“For me personally, there is some anxiety, because I was hoping for a different outcome,” Chemeryz, the teacher, said of Trump’s return to the White House.\n\nTetiana was dismissive, saying Ukraine should work to determine its own fate “without Trump or anyone else.”"

        "full_content": "This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article.\n\nThe data shows that the billionaires’ companies supply vital ingredients to five explosive and gunpowder factories in Russia that are subject to Western sanctions\n\nLONDON, United Kingdom – Chemicals factories founded or owned by some of Russia‘s wealthiest men are supplying ingredients to plants that manufacture explosives used by Moscow’s military during the war in Ukraine, an analysis of railway and financial data shows.\n\nReuters identified five chemical companies, in which five Western-sanctioned billionaires hold stakes, that provided more than 75% of the key chemicals shipped by rail to some of Russia’s largest explosives factories from the start of the war until September this year, according to the railway data.\n\nThe news agency’s analysis demonstrates for the first time how heavily factories forming part of Russia’s war machine rely on these men and their companies.\n\nThe billionaires include Roman Abramovich, former owner of Chelsea Football Club, and Vagit Alekperov, who was ranked by Forbes in April as Russia’s richest man with a fortune estimated at $28.6 billion.\n\nAbramovich and Alekperov did not respond to requests for comment sent via their companies or lawyers. London-listed Evraz, in which Ambramovich holds a 28% stake, said it supplied the chemicals for “civilian use only.” Lukoil, a refiner in which Alekperov retains a shareholding, said it “does not manufacture explosives or any related components.”\n\nAnna Nagurney, a University of Massachusetts professor who closely studies supply chain networks related to the Ukraine-Russia war and reviewed Reuters’ findings, said the five companies were aiding Moscow not only by providing essential chemical ingredients for munitions but also by earning much-needed hard currency from exports of civilian products, including fertilizers.\n\n“These chemical companies may be operating as civilian ones, but they are sustaining the war effort,” Nagurney said.\n\nTo determine from where Russia’s main munitions factories received their supplies, Reuters analyzed the movement of more than 600,000 rail shipments that carried the chemicals needed to make explosives from the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 through September 2024.\n\nThe railway data from two commercial databases in Russia was supplied to Reuters by the Open Source Centre, a British-based NGO devoted to collecting publicly-available intelligence and monitoring potential sanctions violations. It detailed the type of cargo in every railway wagon, the weight, origin and destination, and the names of the company that sent the goods and the company that received them.\n\nReuters cross-checked the data from the two databases to confirm its accuracy. However, the news agency was unable to confirm whether the data included every rail shipment to the explosives factories, or the extent to which the plants received deliveries by road.\n\nThe data showed that the billionaires’ companies supplied vital ingredients to five explosive and gunpowder factories in Russia that are subject to Western sanctions. The plants are subsidiaries of the giant Russian state arms manufacturer and automaker Rostec.\n\nUsing leaked tax invoices covering parts of 2023, Reuters was also able to verify that four of the chemicals firms were suppliers to four of the explosives manufacturers.\n\nNeither the Kremlin, the defense ministry, nor Rostec responded to Reuters’ questions about civilian companies’ role in supplying Russia’s munitions industry.\n\nBefore the war, all the explosives plants, as part of efforts to diversify, also used to make explosives or gunpowder for civilian use. Reuters could not determine whether such civilian sales continue and whether the chemicals supplied might be earmarked for civilian usage.\n\nThomas Klapotke, a professor of energetics at the University of Munich, who helped Reuters analyze the data, said that, while all the raw materials had many potential uses, the combination of wagon-loads of specific chemicals needed for explosives manufacturing arriving at particular plants provided “red flags.”\n\nThe analysis provides fresh evidence that the West’s strategy of imposing sanctions on Russia as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine has failed to curb its military production, according to several experts interviewed by Reuters.\n\nWhile the billionaires themselves are all under Western sanctions, the chemical companies involved have largely escaped major financial penalties or bans on their import of critical goods from the USA or the European Union.\n\nMost of the output of these chemical plants are civilian products like fertilizer that are critical to farming. Long-standing Western policies exempt food from sanctions to prevent famine and diplomatic blowback from developing nations.\n\nPeter Harrell, a former senior White House official who worked on Russia sanctions during the war’s first year and is now a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said perhaps it’s time to review those 2022 decisions now that nations that once relied on Ukraine and Russia for wheat and fertilizer have had time to find alternative sources.\n\n“Potentially, the calculus would weigh towards imposing sanctions on these companies today,” Harrell said, commenting on Reuters’ findings.\n\nHowever, Manish N. Raizada, an agriculture professor at the University of Guelph in Canada, warned that imposing sanctions on Russian chemical companies could put hundreds of millions of small-scale farmers at risk, in return for a minor economic impact on Russia.\n\nSpokespersons for the US Treasury Department, which coordinates Washington’s sanctions, and the United Nations Development Program declined to comment on Reuters findings.\n\nA European Commission spokesperson, in response to questions about the chemicals companies, said: “We are actively exploring the possibilities for additional measures to step up pressure and close loopholes in a manner that would avoid negative implications for food security.”\n\nThe spokesperson stressed that any action would only come after careful analysis of the effectiveness of any measures and their impact on European companies. However, he noted that EU sanctions would already apply to the companies, even if they were not specifically designated, if they were controlled or owned by a sanctioned individual.\n\nArtillery war\n\nThe war in Ukraine has become an artillery duel where a shortage of high explosives available to NATO and Ukraine has allowed Russian forces to gain swathes of territory this year, according to multiple Ukraine commanders interviewed by Reuters.\n\nMoscow is investing heavily in military production and seeking to replenish its munitions stockpiles. In 2024, Russia produced about 2.4 million artillery rounds and imported 3 million from North Korea, according to a Ukraine security official. The North Korean embassy in London didn’t return calls from Reuters seeking comment.\n\nThe five munitions plants supplied by the billionaires’ companies include the massive Sverdlov facility in Dzerzhinsk. The plant is the only significant maker in Russia of the plastic explosives HMX and RDX used in artillery and missiles, according to a Ukrainian intelligence official.\n\nTwo factories run by Eurochem — founded by Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko — supply chemicals to Sverdlov, according to the railway data.\n\nEurochem is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of mineral fertilizers. Its Nevinnomysskiy Nitrogen plant in southwest Russia has sent at least 38,000 metric tons of acetic acid to Sverdlov during the Ukraine war, according to a Reuters analysis of the railway data.\n\nA second Eurochem facility, Novomoskovskiy Nitrogen sent nearly 5,000 metric tons of nitric acid to Sverdlov in the same period, the railway data showed.\n\nBoth acetic acid and nitric acid are used to make HMX and RDX.\n\nAccording to Reuters calculations, based on scientific literature and reviewed by an explosives expert, 5,000 tons of nitric acid could be used to make 3,000 tons of RDX, enough to fill 500,000 large-caliber artillery shells.\n\nThe tax invoices reviewed by Reuters confirmed that Eurochem was a supplier to Sverdlov last year.\n\nIn response to detailed questions, Eurochem said Reuters’ reporting contained “numerous material factual errors.” Specifically, “EuroChem is not part of the defense sector of the Russian economy and none of our products are designed for military purposes,” read a statement from the company, which is headquartered in Switzerland. Eurochem said that any suggestion Melnichenko controlled the company was false.\n\nMelnichenko did not respond to questions. The billionaire, said by Forbes to be worth $17.5 billion, placed his controlling stake in Eurochem into a trust that benefits his wife, as Reuters has reported, after the imposition of sanctions on him by the EU and Nato following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe statement said that while 97% of its output is fertilizer, Eurochem supplies other industrial products, including these chemicals, to a wide number of clients in Russia and abroad. The company didn’t answer Reuters’ questions about the chemical shipments to Sverdlov. Questions sent to the email address on Sverdlov’s website went unanswered.\n\nTax data\n\nAnother fertilizer giant, Uralchem, founded by sanctioned billionaire Dmitry Mazepin, provided Sverdlov more than 27,000 metric tons of ammonium nitrate, the railway data showed. Ammonium nitrate is used to make HMX and RDX, and is also mixed with TNT to produce an explosive called Amatol. Uralchem also supplied 6,000 metric tons of nitric acid from its nitrogen fertilizer plant in Berezniki to Sverdlov, the data showed.\n\nTwo other state-owned munitions plants, the Tambov Gunpowder Plant and Kazan Gunpowder Plant, received shipments of acids from Uralchem, the rail data showed.\n\nThe leaked Russian tax invoices, reviewed by Reuters, also revealed that Uralchem supplied the Sverdlov, Tambov, and Kazan factories as well as the state-owned Perm Powder plant last year.\n\nAsked in detail about the shipments, Uralchem said the information was “incorrect.” It did not provide further details or explanation.\n\nMazepin, who reduced his ownership of the company from 100% to 48% just after the invasion of Ukraine, couldn’t be reached for comment. The Tambov, Perm, and Kazan plants didn’t reply to questions sent to email addresses listed on their websites or on corporate filings.\n\nA steel plant in Siberia owned by London-listed Evraz supplied 5,000 metric tons of toluene — an ingredient for TNT — to the Biysk Oleum Plant, according to the rail data. Evraz was sanctioned in 2022 by the British government which said it supplied steel to the Russian military.\n\nIn a statement, Evraz said it only supplied toluene for “civilian use only.” The Biysk Oleum plant, a unit of Sverdlov, didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn April 2024, the government of Altai region, which includes the city of Biysk, listed the plant among manufacturers that “significantly increased” their 2023 production in fulfilment of state defense procurement contracts.\n\nReuters identified two other billionaire-linked companies supplying chemicals to munitions factories. The Sredneuralsk Copper Smelting Plant (SUMZ) in the Ural mountains, founded by metals magnate Iskander Makhmudov, provides oleum — also known as fuming sulphuric acid — used in the Tambov, Kazan, and Perm powder plants.\n\nThe Lukoil refinery in Perm provided 6,500 metric tons of toluene to the Perm powder plant, Kazan, and Biysk. Lukoil is part-owned by billionaire Alekperov, the company’s former president. Like others, he divested many shares in 2022 but retained an 8.55% stake.\n\nThe tax invoices reviewed by Reuters showed that the Lukoil plant was a supplier to the Perm powder plant last year. They also document shipments from SUMZ to the Kazan and Perm plants.\n\nIn a statement, Lukoil said its Perm refinery “does not manufacture explosives or any related components” and that questions from Reuters about shipments from there contained “absurd speculations.”\n\nSUMZ did not respond to detailed questions. Its parent company, UMMC, which is under sanctions by the US and Britain, did not respond to a request for comment. Makhmudov, who divested his controlling stake in 2022, according to Forbes, also couldn’t be reached for comment. – Rappler.com"

(...) We are not saying that it was done intentionally, but it was done,” he told Azerbaijani state television.\n\nAliyev said that the airliner, which crashed Wednesday in Kazakhstan, was hit by fire from the ground over Russia and “rendered uncontrollable by electronic warfare.\" Aliyev accused Russia of trying to “hush up” the issue for several days, saying he was “upset and surprised” by versions of events put forward by Russian officials.\n\n“Unfortunately, for the first three days we heard nothing from Russia except delirious versions,” he said.\n\nThe crash killed 38 of 67 people on board. The Kremlin said that air defense systems were firing near Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, where the plane attempted to land, to deflect a Ukrainian drone strike.\n\nAliyev said Azerbaijan made three demands to Russia in connection with the crash.\n\n“First, the Russian side must apologize to Azerbaijan. Second, it must admit its guilt. Third, punish the guilty, bring them to criminal responsibility and pay compensation to the Azerbaijani state, the injured passengers and crew members,” he said.\n\nAliyev noted that the first demand was “already fulfilled” when Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized to him on Saturday. Putin called the crash a “tragic incident\" though stopped short of acknowledging Moscow’s responsibility.\n\nHe said that an investigation into the crash was ongoing, and that “the final version (of events) will be known after the black boxes are opened.”\n\nHe noted that Azerbaijan was always “in favor of a group of international experts” investigating the crash, and had “categorically refused” Russia’s suggestion that the Interstate Aviation Committee, which oversees civil aviation in the Commonwealth of Independent States, investigate it.\n\n“It is no secret that this organization consists mostly of Russian officials and is headed by Russian citizens. The factors of objectivity could not be fully ensured here,” Aliyev said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state media on Sunday that Putin had spoken to Aliyev over the phone again, but did not provide details of the conversation.\n\nThe Kremlin also said a joint investigation by Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan was underway at the crash site near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan. The plane was flying from Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku, to Grozny when it turned toward Kazakhstan, hundreds of kilometers (miles) across the Caspian Sea from its intended destination, and crashed while making an attempt to land.\n\nPassengers and crew who survived the crash told Azerbaijani media that they heard loud noises on the aircraft as it was circling over Grozny.\n\nDmitry Yadrov, head of Russia’s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia, said Friday that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting the city, prompting authorities to close the area to air traffic.\n\nThe crash is the second deadly civil aviation accident linked to fighting in Ukraine. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed with a Russian surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 people aboard, as it flew over the area in eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists in 2014.\n\nRussia has denied responsibility, but a Dutch court in 2022 convicted two Russians and a pro-Russia Ukrainian man for their role in downing the plane with an air defense system brought into Ukraine from a Russian military base.

Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev attends an interview with Azerbaijan Television at Heydar Aliyev International Airport outside Baku, Azerbaijan, on December 29, 2024.\n\n(3rd UPDATE) 'We witnessed clear attempts to cover up the matter,' says Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev, who has close ties to Russia and was educated at one of Moscow’s top universities\n\nAzerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said on Sunday, December 29, that a passenger plane that crashed last week, killing 38 people, had been damaged by shooting from the ground in Russia, and he said some in Russia had lied about the cause of the disaster.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin on Saturday, December 28, apologized to Aliyev for Wednesday’s, December 25, “tragic incident” in Russian airspace involving the plane after Russian air defenses engaged Ukrainian attack drones.\n\nA Kremlin statement did not say Russia had shot down the plane, only noting a criminal case had been opened.\n\n“Our plane was shot down by accident,” Aliyev told state television on Sunday, adding that the plane had come under some sort of electronic jamming and had then been shot at while it was approaching the southern Russian city of Grozny.\n\n“Unfortunately, in the first three days we heard only absurd versions from Russia,” Aliyev said, citing statements in Russia that attributed the crash to birds or the explosion of some sort of gas cylinder.\n\n“We witnessed clear attempts to cover up the matter,” said the Azerbaijani leader, who has close ties to Russia and was educated at one of Moscow’s top universities.\n\nAliyev said he wanted Russia to accept it was guilty of downing the plane and punish those responsible for fatally damaging the aircraft.\n\nPutin and Aliyev held another telephone call on Sunday, the Kremlin said. It gave no details but on Saturday it said that both civilian and military specialists were being questioned about what had taken place.\n\nThe chief of Russia’s Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin, on a phone call assured Azerbaijan’s Prosecutor General that Moscow had assigned the investigation to the most experienced experts and that actions were being taken to establish the cause and circumstances of the incident.\n\nThe plane crashed on Wednesday, December 25, near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan after diverting from southern Russia where Ukrainian drones were attacking several cities at the time, according to the Kremlin.\n\nThe extremely rare publicized apology from Putin on Saturday, December 28, is the closest Moscow has come to accepting some blame for the disaster.\n\nFour sources with knowledge of the preliminary findings of Azerbaijan’s investigation into the disaster told Reuters on Thursday, December 26, that Russian air defenses had mistakenly shot it down.\n\nBurials\n\nAliyev’s remarks came as Azerbaijan paid tribute to the pilots and passengers of the plane.\n\nCaptain Igor Kshnyakin and co-pilot Alexander Kalyaninov, both ethnic Russians with Azerbaijan citizenship, and Hokuma Aliyeva, a flight attendant, were given full honors at a ceremony at the Alley of Honour in central Baku attended by Aliyev and his wife, Mehriban.\n\n“The pilots were experienced and knew they would not survive this crash landing,” Aliyev said, praising them for sacrificing themselves by putting the nose down first in an attempt to save some of the passengers.\n\n“In order to save the passengers, they acted with great heroism and as a result of this there were survivors,” he said.\n\nAliyev awarded the crew posthumously with the titles of National Hero of Azerbaijan.\n\nKazakhstan’s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev also awarded citizens who helped rescue the survivors, including emergency workers, medics, police and employees at the airport and a local power company.\n\nThe Embraer passenger jet had flown from Azerbaijan’s capital Baku to Grozny, in Russia’s southern Chechnya region, before veering off hundreds of miles across the Caspian Sea.\n\nAzerbaijan’s presidential office said that after the yet-to-be explained incident over Russian airspace, the pilots battled to control the plane — desperately trying to find a landing spot.\n\nWith holes in the fuselage, some crew injured, passengers praying for their lives in a de-pressurized cabin and the plane spiralling out of control, the pilots flew across the Caspian Sea towards their death in a crash landing.\n\nThe Alley of Honour is Azerbaijan’s most sacred modern burial ground — where prominent politicians, poets and scientists are laid to rest, including Heydar Aliyev, the late father of the current president.\n\nCaptain Kshnyakin’s daughter, Anastasia Kshnyakina, said her father was a dedicated pilot who took his responsibilities to his passengers extremely seriously.\n\n“My father always said: when I take off, I am responsible not only for my life, but also for the lives of all passengers and crew members,” Kshnyakina said.\n\n“With his last flight, he proved what a true hero should be.” – Rappler.com"

Of course, there can be no talk of a deliberate act of terror here,” Aliyev said.\n\n“Therefore, admitting the guilt, apologizing in a timely manner to Azerbaijan, which is considered a friendly country, and informing the public about this—all these were measures and steps that should have been taken,” he said.\n\nMoscow had earlier said that Grozny, where the plane was due to land but instead crashed in western Kazakhstan, was attacked by Ukrainian drones that day.\n\nSpeculation has swirled for days that Russia accidentally shot down the plane, with the United States weighing in Friday saying it had “early indications” the plane was shot."

Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting with members of the Security Council via video link in Moscow, Russia, on December 28, 2024.\n\n(2nd UPDATE) Four sources with knowledge of the preliminary findings of Azerbaijan’s investigation into the disaster tells Reuters that Russian air defenses mistakenly shot it down\n\nMOSCOW, Russia – Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, December 28, apologized to Azerbaijan‘s leader for what the Kremlin called a “tragic incident” over Russia in which an Azerbaijan Airlines plane crashed after Russian air defenses were fired against Ukrainian drones.\n\nThe extremely rare publicized apology from Putin was the closest Moscow had come to accepting some blame for Wednesday’s disaster, although the Kremlin statement did not say Russia had shot down the plane, only noting that a criminal case had been opened.\n\nFlight J2-8243, en route from Baku to the Chechen capital Grozny, crash-landed on Wednesday, December 25, near Aktau in Kazakhstan after diverting from southern Russia, where Ukrainian drones were reported to be attacking several cities. At least 38 people were killed.\n\nFour sources with knowledge of the preliminary findings of Azerbaijan’s investigation told Reuters on Thursday, December 26, that Russian air defenses had mistakenly shot it down. Passengers said they heard a loud bang outside the plane.\n\nPutin called President Ilham Aliyev and “apologized for the tragic incident that occurred in Russian airspace and once again expressed his deep and sincere condolences to the families of the victims and wished a speedy recovery to the injured,” the Kremlin said.\n\n“At that time, Grozny, Mozdok, and Vladikavkaz were being attacked by Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles, and Russian air defense systems repelled these attacks.”\n\nThe Kremlin said “civilian and military specialists” were being questioned.\n\nPutin also phoned Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, his counterpart in Kazakhstan, to express his condolences over the loss of life in the crash, the Kremlin said.\n\nOn Saturday, US President Joe Biden responded to a shouted question about whether Putin should take responsibility for the crash while he was leaving church in St. Croix in the US Virgin Islands, where he is on vacation.\n\n“Apparently he did, but I haven’t spoken to him or my team,” Biden replied.\n\nThe White House said on Friday it had seen early indications suggesting the airliner was possibly brought down by Russian air defense systems and added that Washington had offered assistance to the investigation into the crash.\n\nMSNBC on Friday cited two unidentified US military sources as saying that there was American intelligence that Russia may have mistakenly shot down the airliner after misidentifying it as an incoming drone.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy also said he had called Aliyev to offer condolences, and in his statement on the X platform demanded that Russia provide “clear explanations.”\n\nObjects smashed through airplane’s fuselage\n\nAzerbaijan for its part said Aliyev had noted to Putin that the plane had been “subjected to external physical and technical interference in Russian airspace, resulting in a complete loss of control and redirection to the Kazakh city of Aktau.”\n\nUntil Saturday, Russia’s last working day before a long New Year holiday, the Kremlin had said it was improper to comment on the incident before official investigations were concluded.\n\nThe Embraer jet had flown from Azerbaijan’s capital Baku to Grozny, in Russia’s southern Chechnya region, where the incident occurred, and then travelled, badly damaged, another 280 miles (450 km) across the Caspian Sea.\n\nFootage shot by passengers before the plane crashed showed oxygen masks down and people wearing life jackets. Later videos showed bloodied and bruised passengers climbing out of the wreckage. There were 29 survivors.\n\nBaku cited injuries from objects that had penetrated the aircraft’s fuselage from outside and testimonies from survivors as evidence of “external physical and technical interference”.\n\nThe crash underscored the risks to civil aviation even when aircraft are flying hundreds of miles from a war zone, especially when Ukraine has deployed drones en masse to try to hit back at Russia behind the front lines.\n\nRussia uses electronic jamming to confuse the geolocation and communication systems of Ukrainian drones, which it also targets with air defence systems.\n\nIn 2020, Iranian Revolutionary Guards mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian airliner, killing all 176 on board.\n\nAnd in 2014, Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine, with the loss of 298 passengers and crew, by what Dutch investigators said was a Russian BUK missile system. Russia denied involvement. – Rappler.com"

Putin, the president of Russia, is the biggest supporter of Mindanao becoming an independent country.)\n\nSome social media users seem to believe the video, posting comments like “Yes to the Republic of Mindanao!” and “Yes to Mindanao’s independence!”\n\nThe facts: No documented evidence, official government statement, or credible news report shows that Putin has expressed support for Mindanao becoming an independent country.\n\nThe TikTok post merely shows a photo of Putin and Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte with the superimposed text but provides no evidence or reliable sources to back up this claim.\n\nRussia’s stance: According to analysts, Russia selectively supports separatist movements and ultra-nationalist parties to promote its geopolitical interests. In 2022, Putin recognized the two Russian-backed separatist regions of eastern Ukraine as independent entities, with analysts saying this move could be used as a pretext for war. Russia has since invaded Ukraine, with the ongoing crisis considered as the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two.\n\nSecession calls: In February 2024, former president Rodrigo Duterte called for Mindanao’s independence after accusing the Marcos administration of being behind the so-called people’s initiative to amend the 1987 Constitution and perpetuate the Marcos family in power. The former president later walked back his remarks after Mindanao leaders and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. opposed the secession calls, citing concerns over national stability.\n\nDuterte-Marcos rift: The misleading video surfaced amid rising tensions between the Marcoses and Dutertes. After forming an alliance to secure electoral victories in 2022, the relationship between the country’s top officials has since deteriorated. Duterte, who resigned from Marcos’ Cabinet in June 2024, has since criticized his administration for its handling of national issues.\n\nThe Vice President now faces three impeachment complaints accusing her of financial mismanagement and betrayal of public trust. This follows congressional inquiries into her use of confidential funds and her assassination threat against Marcos.\n\nFalse claims: Amid the controversy surrounding the Vice President, several posts on social media have circulated alleging shows of support for her.\n\nRappler has recently debunked a claim that North Korea had expressed support for Duterte.

For context, always refer to the full article.\n\nPutin dismisses an assertion that Russia was in a weak position, saying that Russia had got much stronger since he ordered troops into Ukraine in 2022\n\nMOSCOW, Russia – Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday, December 19 that he was ready to compromise over Ukraine in possible talks with US President-elect Donald Trump on ending the war and had no conditions for starting talks with the Ukrainian authorities.\n\nTrump, a self-styled master of brokering agreements and author of the 1987 book Trump: the Art of the Deal, has vowed to swiftly end the conflict, but has not yet given any details on how he might achieve that.\n\nPutin, fielding questions on state TV during his annual question and answer session with Russians, told a reporter for a US news channel that he was ready to meet Trump, whom he said he had not spoken to for years.\n\nAsked what he might be able to offer Trump, Putin dismissed an assertion that Russia was in a weak position, saying that Russia had got much stronger since he ordered troops into Ukraine in 2022.\n\n“We have always said that we are ready for negotiations and compromises,” Putin said, after saying that Russian forces, advancing across the entire front, were moving towards achieving their primary goals in Ukraine.\n\n“Soon, those Ukrainians who want to fight will run out, in my opinion, soon there will be no one left who wants to fight. We are ready, but the other side needs to be ready for both negotiations and compromises.”\n\nReuters reported last month that Putin was open to discussing a Ukraine ceasefire deal with Trump, but ruled out making any major territorial concessions and insisted Kyiv abandon its ambitions to join NATO.\n\nPutin said on Thursday that Russia had no conditions to start talks with Ukraine and was ready to negotiate with anyone, including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nBut he said any deal could only be signed with Ukraine’s legitimate authorities, which for now the Kremlin considered to be only the Ukrainian parliament.\n\nZelenskiy, whose term has technically expired but who has delayed an election because of the war, would need to be re-elected for Moscow to consider him a legitimate signatory to any deal to ensure it was legally watertight, said Putin.\n\nPutin dismissed the idea of agreeing a temporary truce with Kyiv, saying only a long-lasting peace deal with Ukraine would suffice.\n\nAny talks should take as their starting point a preliminary agreement reached between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in the early weeks of the war at talks in Istanbul, which was never implemented, he added.\n\nSome Ukrainian politicians regard that draft deal as akin to a capitulation which would have neutered Ukraine’s military and political ambitions.\n\nWar\n\nRussia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine has left tens of thousands of dead, displaced millions and triggered the biggest crisis in relations between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nRussia, which casts the conflict as a defensive special military operation designed to stop dangerous NATO expansion to the east, controls around a fifth of Ukraine and has taken several thousand square kilometres of territory this year.\n\nDetermined to incorporate four Ukrainian regions into Russia, Moscow’s forces have taken village after village in the east and are now threatening strategically important cities such as Pokrovsk, a major road and rail hub.\n\nPutin said the fighting was complex, so it was “difficult and pointless to guess what lies ahead… (but) we are moving, as you said, towards solving our primary tasks, which we outlined at the beginning of the special military operation.”\n\nDiscussing the continued presence of Ukrainian forces in Russia’s Kursk region, Putin said Kyiv’s troops would be forced out, but declined to say exactly when that would happen.\n\nThe war has transformed the Russian economy and Putin said it was showing signs of overheating which was stoking worryingly high inflation. But he said growth was higher than many other economies such as Britain.\n\nAsked if he’d do anything differently, he said he should have sent troops into Ukraine sooner than 2022 and that Russia should have been better prepared for the conflict.\n\nAsked by a BBC reporter if he’d looked after Russia, something that Boris Yeltsin had asked him to do before handing over the presidency at the end of 1999, Putin said he had.\n\n“We have moved back from the edge of the abyss,” Putin said.\n\n“I have done everything to ensure that Russia is an independent and sovereign power that is able to make decisions in its own interests.”\n\nRussia, Putin said, had made proposals to Syria’s new rulers about Russia’s military bases there and most people that Moscow had spoken to on the issue favoured them staying.\n\nRussia would need to think about whether the bases should remain or not, he added, but rumors about the death of Russian influence in the Middle East were exaggerated.\n\nPutin touted what he said was the invincibility of the “Oreshnik” hypersonic missile that Russia has already test-fired at a Ukrainian military factory, saying he was ready to organise another launch at Ukraine and see if Western air defence systems could shoot it down.\n\nIn Brussels, Zelenskiy addressed Putin’s missile suggestion during a press conference at a European Council meeting, remarking of Putin: “Do you think he is a sane person?” – Rappler.com"

AFP\n\nUkraine is entering another winter of war as its energy grid is already badly damaged by Russian attacks and Trump spoke as Russian forces were almost at the gates of the key eastern city of Pokrovsk.\n\nAddressing top military generals in an end-of-year meeting on Monday, Putin struck a defiant and optimistic tone, claiming his troops had the upper hand across the entire front line.\n\nThe comments come with Russia’s army advancing across eastern Ukraine at their fastest pace since the first weeks of the offensive.\n\n“Russian troops are firmly holding the strategic initiative along the entire line of contact,” Putin said.\n\nHe said Russia’s army had seized 189 Ukrainian settlements this year and called 2024 a “landmark year in the achievement of the goals of the special military operation”, using Moscow’s official language for its campaign.\n\nSpeaking after Putin at the same meeting, Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said Russia’s troops had seized a total of almost 4,500 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory in this year and were now gaining around 30 square kilometers a day.\n\nRussia’s army said Monday that it had captured another small village in the Donetsk region as part of its latest advance.\n\nAFP analysis of Institute for the Study of War data found that in November Russian troops advanced at their fastest pace since March 2022 — the first full month of the offensive.

Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, chief of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops, attends a press conference in Moscow, Russia, in this still image from video released November 5, 2024.\n\nLieutenant General Igor Kirillov, who was chief of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops, is killed outside an apartment building along with his assistant when a bomb hidden in an electric scooter went off\n\nMOSCOW, Russia – A top Russian general accused by Ukraine of being responsible for the use of chemical weapons against Ukrainian troops was assassinated in Moscow by Ukraine’s SBU intelligence service on Tuesday morning, December 17, in the most high-profile killing of its kind.\n\nLieutenant General Igor Kirillov, who was chief of Russia’s Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops, was killed outside an apartment building along with his assistant when a bomb hidden in an electric scooter went off, Russia’s Investigative Committee, which probes serious crimes, said.\n\nAn SBU source confirmed to Reuters that the Ukrainian intelligence agency had been behind the hit. “The liquidation of the chief of the radiation and chemical protection troops of the Russian Federation is the work of the SBU,” the source said.\n\nThe source said that a scooter containing explosives was detonated, killing both Kirillov and his aide, as they stepped into the entrance of a house on Ryazansky Prospekt in Moscow.\n\nKirillov, 54, is the most senior Russian military officer to be assassinated inside Russia by Ukraine and his murder is likely to prompt the Russian authorities to review security protocols for the army’s top brass and to find a way to avenge his killing.\n\nFormer president Dmitry Medvedev, now a senior Russian security official, was cited by the state RIA news agency as saying that Ukraine’s military and political leadership now faced imminent revenge for Kirillov’s murder.\n\nMoscow holds Ukraine responsible for a string of high-profile assassinations on its soil designed to weaken morale and punish those Kyiv regards guilty of war crimes. Ukraine, which says Russia’s war against it poses an existential threat to the Ukrainian state, has made clear it regards such targeted killings as a legitimate tool.\n\nReuters photographs and video from the scene showed a shattered entrance to an apartment building with bomb-blackened bricks and the doors hanging off their hinges and what looked like two bodies lying beneath black plastic sheets on the snow.\n\nInvestigators said they had opened a criminal case into the murder of two servicemen. Law enforcement sources told Russian media a terrorism case was likely to be opened.\n\nKirillov worked ‘fearlessly for the motherland’\n\nRussia denies Ukrainian allegations it uses chemical weapons on the battlefield and Kirillov, who was married with two sons, was himself sometimes shown on state TV giving briefings at the Defence Ministry in which he accused Ukraine of violating nuclear safety protocols or the West of various alleged crimes.\n\nMaria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry, paid tribute to Kirillov, saying he had worked “fearlessly” for “the Motherland” to expose what she said were the West’s chemical weapons-related and other crimes and what Moscow says were cover-ups in Syria and elsewhere.\n\nBritain in October imposed sanctions on Kirillov and his nuclear defence forces for using riot control agents and over multiple reports of the use of the toxic choking agent chloropicrin on the battlefield.\n\nSuch agents, Ukraine has alleged, are used to disorientate its troops leaving them unable to defend themselves against Russian attacks.\n\nKirillov was murdered a day after Ukrainian state prosecutors were reported to have charged him in absentia with the alleged use of banned chemical weapons, the Kyiv Independent cited the SBU as saying at the time.\n\nThe Lieutenant General was also listed in a sprawling unofficial Ukrainian database of people considered to be enemies of the country called Myrotvorets (Peacemaker). A photograph of Kirillov on the website was overwritten with the word “Liquidated” in red letters on Tuesday morning.\n\nRussia says Ukraine has carried out a string of targeted assassinations on its soil since the start of Moscow’s full-scale war on Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nThe most high-profile cases include the 2022 killing of Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian nationalist ideologue Alexander Dugin, in a car bomb attack, the murder of pro-war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky in a 2023 cafe bombing, and the shooting last year of a Russian submarine commander accused of war crimes by Kyiv.\n\nRussia’s radioactive, chemical and biological defense troops, known as RKhBZ, which Kirillov commanded, are special forces who operate under conditions of radioactive, chemical and biological contamination and who are tasked with protecting ground forces operating in extreme conditions. – Rappler.com"

Instead, we must deprive it of the means of terror. I reiterate my call for the urgent delivery of 20 NASAMS, HAWK, or IRIS-T air defense systems,” Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote in a post on X.\n\nAn industry source told Reuters that Friday’s attack had targeted Ukrainian power substations and that it had included more strikes on gas infrastructure than in past assaults.\n\nAs the attack unfolded, energy officials announced longer, emergency power cuts, but they did not make clear whether that was because of new damage or whether it was a precautionary measure. There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nAround a half of power company Yasno’s 3.5 million consumers were without power on Friday morning, their CEO said.\n\nThe extent of any damage was hard to assess. After repeated Russian attacks on the power grid, officials reveal little detailed information about the outcome of strikes and the state of the network.\n\nLviv region targeted\n\nAuthorities in the western region of Lviv confirmed there had been attacks on energy facilities there and that the schedule of power cuts would have to be changed, implying there had been damage.\n\nRussia says it does not target civilian infrastructure, but that it sees the power system as a military target.\n\nUkraine’s energy system has already suffered 11 waves of attacks this year, which have caused widespread damage and lengthy power cuts all over the country.\n\nThe morning missile strike was preceded by an overnight attack involving dozens of drones.\n\nRussian troops, meanwhile, are notching up their fastest battlefield gains in eastern Ukraine since 2022 in their drive to seize the entire industrial Donbas region.\n\n“The enemy continues its terror. Once again, the energy sector across Ukraine is under massive attack,” Galushchenko wrote in a post on Facebook. – Rappler.com"
