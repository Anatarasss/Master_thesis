        "full_content": "Reuters spoke to three executives and half a dozen former and current employees for this story on the depth of change at what used to be Russia's most valuable company. All requested anonymity, citing fear of professional repercussions.\n\n\"Gazprom has been handed the social task of gasification and secure gas supply to the economy and the population at low regulated prices,\" he said.\n\nAlexei Grivach, from pro-Kremlin think tank the National Energy Security Fund, said Gazprom's less glamorous focus in the near future will be to bring gas to more Russian homes.\n\nWith no European sales, the remaining workers are focused mainly on litigation with former EU buyers, the sources told Reuters. Gazprom Export is \"just a shell,\" one of the sources said.\n\nGazprom's media department and the Russian energy ministry did not respond to detailed requests for comment on the story's findings.\n\nThat's down from 600 employees five years ago, at the peak of Russian exports to Europe. The possible sale of the building and cuts at the unit have not been previously reported.\n\nThe number of staff at Gazprom Export, once the most prosperous unit of the company, overseeing Soviet and Russia's gas sales to Europe for over half a century, has shrunk to just a few dozen employees, the same two sources told Reuters.\n\nGazprom is arguably the Russian business hardest hit by the international sanctions imposed after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago. Although Russia's economy has been resilient, growing signs of strain have appeared in several industries. Reuters has previously reported that President Vladimir Putin is concerned as heavy military spending distorts the wider economy.\n\nReeling under multi-billion-dollar losses and scrambling for savings, the company is now considering putting the palazzo up for sale along with other luxury properties it owns, according to a Gazprom executive and another source with knowledge of internal discussions at Gazprom.\n\nInstead, the opulent offices have come to symbolize Gazprom's rapid decline, dragged down by the almost total loss of European markets after the war in Ukraine ruptured Russia's ties with the West.\n\n\"This is symbolic,\" he said, referring to the modern new offices in Russia's most European city. \"Europe will increasingly need Russian gas.\"\n\n(Reuters) -When the CEO of Russian state gas giant Gazprom, Alexei Miller, opened a lavish Italian palazzo-styled building in central St Petersburg to house the company's export arm 11 years ago, he augured a future funded by European sales.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWIDER CUTS\n\nGazprom's problems extend well beyond the export unit, the conversations with the employees reveal. Two of the sources told Reuters that Miller has now approved plans to cut 1,500 jobs at the parent company's headquarters in Russia and Europe's tallest skyscraper, the British-designed Lakhta Centre, also in St Petersburg.\n\nThe dismissals at Gazprom headquarters have yet to be announced but staff have been asked to prepare individual presentations about why they should keep their jobs, according to one of the sources, who said employees were told to write up a description of their job functions in case of overlaps.\n\nThe source said the process was expected to be completed within a few weeks.\n\nThe cuts add up to about 40% of the staff at Gazprom's headquarters, but a small fraction of its half million strong work force, spread across Russia.\n\nManagement misjudged how resolute European capitals would be, according to one of the executives, who said the thinking inside the company was that Europe would quickly be back \"begging\" for Russian gas supplies to resume.\n\nDespite the economic pain of higher energy costs, the EU has not rolled back sanctions.\n\n\"We proved to be wrong,\" the executive said.\n\nU.S. gas exporters quickly moved to replace Russian gas in Europe. The U.S. has become the biggest exporter of LNG to the continent, with supplies tripling since 2021. Europe still buys Russia's sea-borne liquefied natural gas (LNG), but mainly from Gazprom's rivals, Novatek's Yamal LNG plant.\n\nThe European Union aims to end its use of Russian fossil fuels by 2027 and its overall gas consumption has decreased in part due to a shift to renewable energy sources.\n\nLast year, Gazprom posted a net loss of $7 billion for 2023, its first since 1999, the year Putin came to power. It posted another loss in the first 9 months of 2024, the latest period for which figures are available.\n\nGazprom's share price fell in mid-December to its lowest since January 2009, touching 106.1 roubles, a decline of more than a third since the start of 2024.\n\nA few months after announcing the annual loss, Gazprom said last year it was selling a portfolio of high-end properties that include well-known luxury hotels in Moscow and in Armenia's Valley of Flowers.\n\nGazprom has a long history of investing in luxury property, which it uses to reward employees with holidays, and to host conferences and events such as the 2014 Olympic Games.\n\nTRUMP TRADE\n\nThe return of Donald Trump to the White House has helped Gazprom's share price recover to around 180 roubles on hopes a swift Ukrainian peace deal would lead to the restoration of exports to Europe, Alpha Bank said in a note last month.\n\nHowever, there are few signs the continent will rush to again tie itself to Russian gas, despite a Financial Times report that a long-time ally of Putin is lobbying the United States to allow investors to restart the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline that carried gas from Russia via Germany. Germany says it will stick with its policy of independence from Russian energy.\n\nEven if there were appetite, Nord Stream is out of service and partly damaged.\n\nCederic Cremers, executive vice president of integrated gas at Shell, said in late February at the International Energy week conference in London in response to whether Russian pipeline gas could return to Europe: \"That depends on a lot of things.\"\n\nHe cited multiple arbitration cases with Gazprom and asked \"will customers and Europe still want the same dependence on Russian gas?\"\n\nGazprom's share in EU markets has shrunk to 7% from over 35% before EU sanctions, European Commission data shows.\n\nIts market capitalisation as of Wednesday stands at around $46 billion, down from the all-time high of $330.9 billion in 2007, according to the Moscow stock exchange, Gazprom and Reuters calculations.\n\nMILLER'S TIME\n\nAs the company adjusts to its new role as a domestic gas supplier, the lofty ambitions of CEO Miller have been dashed. In 2007, Miller said the company would eventually have a market capitalisation of $1 trillion.\n\nAt the time this seemed possible. Russia holds a fifth of the planet's gas resources, rendering Gazprom the world's largest natural gas company by reserves.\n\nAt its height, Gazprom - formed in the Soviet Union from the Ministry of the Gas Industry - generated revenues that accounted for over 5 percent of Russia's $2 trillion annual gross domestic product.\n\nThe company has been run by Miller, a close friend of Putin since the Russian president was mayor of St Petersburg in 1990s, for the past 24 years. Miller has been on the U.S. sanctions list since 2018, barring U.S. citizens and entities from any dealings with him.\n\nGazprom controls entire towns in Siberia and the Arctic such as Nadym where tens of thousands of employees and their families depend on it as the sole employer. Yury Shafranik, Russian fuel and energy minister from 1993 to 1996, told Reuters in 2023 that Gazprom had been a \"state within a state.\"\n\nThe sources Reuters spoke to did not describe plans for job cuts or the closure of production assets in such company towns.\n\nA STEPPE TOO FAR?\n\nPutin's long-term promise to replace Europe's markets with exports to China look optimistic at best. Even the most ambitious projects currently being considered to pipe gas eastward would not amount to half of the previous annual peak exports of 180 billion cubic meters (bcm)\n\nMuch of Russia's gas went through pipelines to Europe. When Germany and other European countries stopped buying it, there was nowhere else for the surplus to go.\n\nIn contrast, Russia's oil exporters have been able to redirect tankers to refineries in Asian countries that have not imposed sanctions.\n\nAlthough gas production recovered slightly last year from a record low in 2023 on increased domestic demand and exports to China, there is little pipeline capacity to expand that trade.\n\nFor now there is only one route for Russia to supply pipeline gas to China – the Power of Siberia pipeline, which transports 38 bcm per year.\n\nA second smaller pipeline with a capacity of 10 bcm per year is under construction, set to connect the Pacific island of Sakhalin to China by 2027.\n\nRussia and China have been in talks for over a decade about building a third pipeline, the Power of Siberia 2, to carry 50 bcm and meet over a tenth of Chinese gas consumption. This plan would take years to fully develop and discussions have stalled due to price differences, according to media reports.\n\nIn May, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said Russia and China expected to a sign a contract \"in the near future\" on the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline.\n\nPutin and China's President Xi Jinping discussed Power of Siberia-2 in January, news agency Interfax reported, but no agreement has been reached.\n\nChina National Petroleum Corporation, which is dealing with Gazprom, declined to comment on the talks. The government of Russia did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nEven if the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline were completed quickly, volumes and pricing terms are likely to be much lower than past exports to Europe, analysts from the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.\n\n\"By 2030, Russian gas export revenues might fall by 55–80 percent compared to 2022, a year of record-high revenues for the Russian gas industry, at $165 billion,\" they said in a research note last year.\n\n(Reporting by Reuters; Editing by Simon Webb and Frank Jack Daniel)"

        "full_content": "By Aleksandar Vasovic\n\nBELGRADE (Reuters) - Russia's Gazprom Neft transferred stakes of around 5.15% in Serbia's NIS oil company to Gazprom, in an attempt to ward off U.S. sanctions that could result in crude supply cuts for the Balkan country.\n\nThe U.S. placed sanctions on Russia's oil sector on January 10, and gave Gazprom Neft 45 days to exit ownership of NIS. The deadline expires at 0600 local time (0500 GMT) on Thursday.\n\nAccording to notices made public by Belgrade stock exchange BELEX, Gazprom Neft reduced its stake in NIS to 44.85% from 50%. At the same time, Gazprom increased its stake in the Serbian oil company to 11.3% from 6.15%.\n\nThe changes mean Gazprom Neft no longer has an absolute majority in NIS, which operates Serbia's sole crude oil refinery in Pancevo, just outside the capital Belgrade.\n\nThey follow a similar cosmetic change in 2022 when the company was trying to avoid EU sanctions. It unclear whether they will satisfy U.S. authorities.\n\n\"We are continuing talks with both the United States and Russia to reach a solution,\" Serbia's Energy Minister Dubravka Djedovic Handanovic said in a live TV broadcast on Wednesday.\n\nThe Serbian government holds a further 29.87% stake in NIS, with small shareholders accounting for the remainder.\n\nSerbia, an historical ally of Russia, has submitted a formal request to the U.S. Treasury Department for a waiver of sanctions for 90 days to allow it to consider a \"sustainable solution that would lead to the lifting of sanctions\".\n\nFollowing efforts to store fuel and find alternative supplies, Handanovic said the government has enough to supply the market for at least three months.\n\nBut in the absence of a waiver, Serbia could face a shortfall as NIS, which supplies about 80% of the domestic retail market with crude oil and gas derivatives, would be unable to import crude oil through Croatia's pipeline operator Janaf.\n\nThe Belgrade stock exchange suspended trading of NIS shares on January 14, citing the introduction of the U.S. sanctions.\n\n(Reporting by Aleksandar Vasovic; Writing by Angeliki Koutantou; Editing by Louise Heavens, Edward McAllister and Barbara Lewis)"

There was no vote against the resolution, while five Western members — Denmark, France, Greece, Slovenia, United Kingdom — abstained.\n\nEarlier, the UN General Assembly rejected the US-drafted resolution, which passed only after it was amended to state that the conflict was the result of a “full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation.”\n\nBut at the Security Council, the Western members failed in their attempt to include any reference to Russia’s invasion as their motions to seeking to amend the resolution failed to garner enough votes — exposing a sharp split in transatlantic relations.\n\nThe short US resolution mourns the loss of life in the “Russia-Ukraine conflict”, reiterates the UN’s purpose is to maintain international peace and security and peacefully settle disputes, and calls for a swift end to the conflict and a lasting peace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong others who supported the resolution were China and Russia.\n\nExplaining his vote in the Security Council, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, the alternate permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, said that he had voted in favour of the US resolution as it was in line with Pakistan’s clear and consistent position on the conflict in Ukraine, and its repeated calls for immediate cessation of hostilities and a negotiated settlement of the conflict.\n\nNoting that the “priority of peace has remained largely absent and elusive”, even as the security, humanitarian and economic crises have intensified, he said: “A different approach was perhaps required.”\n\nThe Pakistani envoy therefore expressed hope that today’s resolution will “lend impetus to an inclusive peace process that yields a durable solution in accordance with international law”.\n\nPakistan, he said, remained deeply concerned by this tragic conflict, which has already left in its wake immense human suffering and massive damage to infrastructure, economy and the society, highlighting geo-political tensions and the economic consequences that have been particularly severe especially for developing countries."

        "full_content": "Nearly three years after Russia invaded Ukraine, Vladimir Putin’s economy is entering a critical phase as inflation, shortages, and shrinking cash reserves constrain his war effort soon, a Russia expert said.\n\nRussia’s economy is facing a “moment of truth” as high inflation, an ailing private sector, and critical shortages are poised to constrain Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine, according to economist and author Anders Åslund.\n\nNearly three years after launching its invasion, Russia is headed for stagflation, meaning high inflation combined with minimal growth, he wrote at Project Syndicate on Jan. 14.\n\nWhile official statistics show inflation quickened to an annual pace of 9.5% in December from 8.9% in November, other measures suggest it’s far higher. For example, independent research firm Romir has calculated that prices for a basket of certain consumer goods jumped by 22% in September.\n\n“His war on Ukraine has caused both high and rising prices and labor shortages, because many workers have been mobilized or killed, while many others have fled the country,” said Åslund, who wrote Russia’s Crony Capitalism: The Path From Market Economy to Kleptocracy.\n\nMeanwhile, defense spending is rising while the government’s ability to raise funds via tax hikes and bond offerings is limited, he added.\n\nThat leaves Moscow’s oft-tapped National Wealth Fund, which has already seen liquid assets plunge to $31 billion from $117 billion before the war, to fill any gaps. Åslund estimated that what’s left in the fund is only enough to finance three-quarters of Russia’s budget deficit this year.\n\nOn top of that, the ruble’s recent plunge is adding inflationary pressure, and exports are unlikely to offer much help, he said. Sanctions that are keeping Western technology out of Russia are weighing on businesses as well.\n\n“Strained by these factors, the Russian economy is approaching its moment of truth,” Åslund wrote. “Inflation will continue to rise in 2025, and people will get even angrier over higher food prices. Major bankruptcies are looming, and the Russian state cannot afford large bailouts. Business leaders are fiercely objecting to high interest rates, and the shortage of labor—and soldiers—is reaching a crisis stage.”\n\nThe worst shortage, however, is budget cash as liquid reserves are on pace to run out this fall, he predicted.\n\nBy then, budget cuts will be necessary, while the Kremlin may have to resort to the “Soviet sins” of price controls and rationing.\n\n“As the risk of a financial crash rises, Russia’s imperiled economy is about to pose serious constraints on Putin’s war,” he added."

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 93 cents, or 1.25%, to $73.32.\n\nBoth benchmarks had risen more than 1% earlier in the session.\n\n\"The oil market is being weighed down by the significant increases in gasoline and diesel inventories that we've seen over the last couple of weeks,\" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. Fuel inventories swelled as refiners continued ramping up production, he added.\n\nGasoline stocks rose by 6.3 million barrels last week to 237.7 million barrels, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.5 million-barrel build, according to data released on Wednesday from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nDistillate stockpiles rose by 6.1 million barrels in the week to 128.9 million barrels, versus expectations for a 600,000-barrel rise.\n\n\"I would be concerned if we saw more substantial products builds over the next few weeks. And in the meantime, the cold snap could constrain crude oil supply and increase heating oil demand,\" said Josh Young, chief investment officer at Bison Interests.\n\nCrude inventories fell by 959,000 barrels to 414.6 million barrels in the week, compared with analysts' expectations for a 184,000-barrel draw.\n\nA stronger dollar also pressured prices by making oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.\n\nLimiting the losses, oil output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries fell in December after two months of increases as field maintenance in the United Arab Emirates offset a Nigerian output hike and gains elsewhere in the group.\n\nIn Russia, oil output averaged 8.971 million barrels a day in December, below the country's target, Bloomberg reported, citing the energy ministry.\n\nAnalysts expect oil prices to be down on average this year from 2024 due in part to production increases from non-OPEC countries.\n\n\"We are holding to our forecast for Brent crude to average $76/bbl in 2025, down from an average of $80/bbl in 2024,\" BMI, a division of Fitch Group, said in a client note.\n\n(Reporting by Nicole Jao in New York, Katya Golubkova in Tokyo, Jeslyn Lerh in Singapore and Arunima Kumar in Bengaluru; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle, Nick Zieminski and Nia Williams)"

The measure offers Russian banks enhanced protection to temporarily suspend transactions involving the CBDC.\n\nCustomers will be notified about possible fraud, giving them 24 hours to confirm or decline the CBDC transaction.\n\nIn the United States, CBDCs have attracted widespread criticism among crypto enthusiasts, who fear their potential to introduce financial surveillance and erode privacy. Earlier this year, U.S. president-elect Donald Trump tapped into this fear by pledging to \"never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency.”\n\n“Such a currency would give a federal government – our federal government – absolute control over your money,\" Trump said about the risks of the nascent technology. \"They could take your money, and you wouldn’t even know it was gone.\"\n\nThis year, Texas senator Ted Cruz and several Republican senators introduced the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, a bill to stop the federal government from launching a retail CBDC in America. “The Biden administration salivates at the thought of infringing on our freedom and intruding on the privacy of citizens to surveil their personal spending habits, which is why Congress must clarify that the Federal Reserve has no authority to implement a CBDC,” Cruz said.\n\nThe legislation represents the third time Cruz has filed legislation to stop the federal government from establishing a CBDC in the United States.\n\nWhile the U.S. is still exploring the potential applications of a CBDC, there are no formal plans to introduce one.

        "full_content": "A drone view shows emergency specialists working at the crash site of an Azerbaijan Airlines passenger plane near the city of Aktau, Kazakhstan December 25, 2024. — Reuters\n\nBAKU: Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev on Sunday demanded that Russia admit that it fired at an Azerbaijan Airlines passenger jet before it crashed, accusing Moscow of initially trying to cover up the cause of the fatal disaster.\n\nAliyev accused in an interview to state media at Baku airport four days after the AZAL Embraer 190 plane crashed in Kazakhstan, killing 38 of the 67 people on board. Azerbaijani officials have suggested that a Russian air-defence system hit the aircraft as it tried to land in Grozny, the capital of the Russian Republic of Chechnya.\n\nOn Sunday, the Kazakhstan transport ministry said that the aeroplane’s black box would be sent for analysis to Brazil, which manufactures the Embraer plane. Aliyev’s unusually forthright accusation of his country’s traditional ally came a day after he spoke by telephone to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nA Kremlin statement about the phone call did not indicate that Putin had claimed responsibility for the crash.\n\n“The facts are that the Azerbaijani civilian plane was damaged from the outside over Russian territory, near the city of Grozny, and almost lost control,” Aliyev told state television. “We also know that electronic warfare systems put our plane out of control... At the same time, as a result of fire from the ground, the tail of the plane was also severely damaged,” he said.\n\nAliyev said that while “our plane was hit by accident”, Baku was angry that Moscow had tried to hide the cause of the crash and demanded its ally admit responsibility. He said it was “regrettable and surprising” that Moscow “put forward theories” that, he said, “clearly showed the Russian side wanted to cover up the issue”. “For the first three days, we heard nothing from Russia except some absurd theories,” he said, adding that these included the plane hitting a flock of birds. He called the theory “completely removed” from reality, pointing out that the plane’s “fuselage is riddled with holes”.\n\nRussia has said that Grozny was being attacked by Ukrainian drones the day that the AZAL flight tried to land.\n\nAliyev urged Moscow to publicly apologise to his country, saying Baku had made official “demands” to Russia two days ago. “First, the Russian side must apologise to Azerbaijan. “Second, it must acknowledge its guilt.\n\n“Third, those responsible must be punished, brought to criminal responsibility, and compensation must be paid to the Azerbaijani state, as well as to the injured passengers and crew members. “These are our conditions,” Aliyev said, in unusually strong language directed at Moscow.\n\nThe Kremlin on Saturday said that during their phone conversation, Putin had apologised to Azerbaijan over the “tragic incident”.\n\nPutin said Russian air defence was operating in Grozny on December 25 when the plane tried to land, before diverting and crashing in western Kazakhstan. The Kremlin statement did not indicate that Putin had said Russia was at fault. Later on Saturday, the Russian leader called for a “transparent” probe into the crash.\n\nRussian news agencies reported that Putin and Aliyev discussed the crash again on Sunday.\n\nThe United States this week said that it had “early indications” that Russia was responsible for the crash but did not provide details."

Dr Kolomeets was delivering keynote address at a webinar on ‘State of the Climate Change in Asia 2023’ organised here by Institute of Regional Studies (IRS),\n\nDr Kolomeets discussed concerning trends in findings from WMO. Additionally, she noted anomalies in precipitation and snow coverage and the ongoing increase in glacial loss in the South Asian region.\n\nDr Fahad Saeed, a South Asian regional climate scientist from Climate Analytics, highlighted Pakistan's pivotal geolocation, a convergence point for summer monsoons and winter western disturbances. This positioning makes the country especially susceptible to climate variations evident in events such as the 2022 floods, Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) and heatwaves, he said adding that there was a great need of integrating scientific insights into decision-making at national, subnational, and local levels.\n\nJauhar Saleem, president, IRS, observed that the narrative of climate change reveals deep-seated inequality. Drawing from his experience representing Pakistan at forums like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), he noted the stark disparity in climate change effects between developing and developed nations. He emphasised the slow progress seen in past Conferences of Parties (COPs) and called for enhanced collaboration to address humanity’s greatest existential threat.\n\nTalha Tufail Bhatti from IRS noted that this year’s COP financial targets disappointed developing nations. With at least 10 countries experiencing extreme temperatures over 50°C and economic losses reaching $202.7 billion in 2023, the pledges were insufficient. He said that there is a need for swift and ambitious action from the international community, based on the experts' insights."

This year alone, bitcoin mining used roughly 17% of the country's energy, according to one estimate. While Russia has moved to levy restrictions on the industry, it has spurred some miners to move underground.\n\n“The owners of illegal cryptocurrency mining installations are coming up with new methods of 'circumventing' the law - they install mining farms underground,\" Abdulmuslim Abdulmuslimov, Dagestan’s prime minister, told Reuters.\n\nIn the past, Russia prohibited cryptocurrency as a payment method but still allowed it for cross-border payments. As the war in Ukraine escalates, Russia's alleged use of crypto to evade sanctions has gained renewed prominence, prompting the U.S. to increasingly target crypto transactions originating from Russia.\n\nThis past July, Russia unveiled a new law greenlighting the use of crypto for international trade. The legislation allows the country's central bank to establish \"experimental\" infrastructure for crypto transactions. \"We are taking a historic decision in the financial sphere,\" said the head of the Russian parliament's finance committee Anatoly Aksakov about the move."

Since leaving the pact, the United States has tested missiles with a similar profile.\n\nRussia fired a new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile known as “Oreshnik”, or Hazel Tree, at Ukraine on Nov. 21 in what Putin said was a direct response to strikes on Russia by Ukrainian forces with U.S. and British missiles."

At that time, Grozny, Mozdok and Vladikavkaz were being attacked by Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles, and Russian air defence systems repelled these attacks,” the Kremlin said.\n\nThe Kremlin said the call took place at Putin’s request. Azerbaijan’s president had noted that the plane had been “subjected to external physical and technical interference in Russian airspace, resulting in a complete loss of control and redirection to the Kazakh city of Aktau,” according to Azerbaijan’s presidential office.\n\nThe Embraer EMBR3.SA passenger jet had flown from Azerbaijan’s capital Baku to Grozny, in Russia’s southern Chechnya region, before veering off hundreds of miles across the Caspian Sea.\n\nStatements by Azerbaijani officials suggest Baku believes the plane was hit mid-air, while the US has said it had “early indications” Russian air defence may have been responsible for the crash."

At the same time, as a result of fire from the ground, the tail of the plane was also severely damaged,\" he said.\n\nAliyev said that while \"of course, our plane was hit by accident\", Baku was angry that Moscow had apparently tried to hide the cause of the crash and demanded its ally admit what happened.\n\nHe said it was \"regrettable and surprising\" that Moscow \"put forward theories\" that, he said, \"clearly showed he Russian side wanted to cover up the issue\".\n\n\"For the first three days, we heard nothing from Russia except some absurd theories,\" he said, adding that these included the plane hitting a flock of birds.\n\nHe called the theory \"completely removed\" from reality, pointing out that the plane's \"fuselage is riddled with holes\".\n\nRussia has said Grozny was being attacked by Ukrainian drones the day the AZAL flight tried to land.\n\nAzerbaijani demands\n\nAliyev urged Moscow to issue a public apology to his country, saying Baku had made official \"demands\" to Russia two days ago.\n\n\"First, the Russian side must apologise to Azerbaijan.\n\n\"Second, it must acknowledge its guilt.\n\n\"Third, those responsible must be punished, brought to criminal responsibility, and compensation must be paid to the Azerbaijani state, as well as to the injured passengers and crew members.\n\n\"These are our conditions,\" Aliyev said, in unusually strong language towards Moscow.\n\nThe Kremlin said on Saturday that during their phone conversation, Putin had apologised to Azerbaijan over the \"tragic incident\".\n\nPutin said Russian air defence was operating in Grozny on December 25 when the plane tried to land, before diverting and crashing in western Kazakhstan.\n\nThe Kremlin statement gave no indication that Putin had said Russia was at fault. Later on Saturday, the Russian leader called for a \"transparent\" probe into the crash.\n\nAliyev's office said on Saturday he had \"emphasised\" during the call that the plane had been subject to outside interference over Russia.\n\nRussian news agencies reported that Putin and Aliyev discussed the crash again on Sunday.\n\nThe United States said this week it had \"early indications\" that Russia was responsible for the crash but did not provide details.\n\nThe European Union called on Saturday for a \"swift\" and \"independent\" probe into the crash."

On board the ships are crews of 15 and 14. As a result of the accident there was an oil spill,\" said federal shipping agency Rosmorrechflot.\n\nReports on crew numbers varied with the emergency situations ministry putting them at 13 and 14.\n\nDramatic videos posted online showed the stern of the Volgoneft-212 ship broken off and floating vertically in the water. Interfax reported that some of the crew members were in the water.\n\nThe emergency situations ministry later said that 13 sailors had been evacuated from the first ship, but \"unfortunately one of them had died\".\n\n\"Two tug boats and two helicopters have been sent to the tankers,\" the federal shipping agency said, adding that \"measures are being taken to eliminate the oil spill\".\n\nKey route for Russian grain, oil exports\n\nThe Kerch Strait is a key route for exports of Russian grain and is also used for exports of crude oil, fuel oil and liquefied natural gas.\n\nIn September, Ukraine accused Russia at an international court of flouting sea law by trying to keep the Kerch Strait under its sole control, something Moscow dismisses at groundless.\n\nThe Emergencies Ministry said it was still in contact with the other tanker and its crew after the ship ran aground 80 m from shore near the port of Taman at the south end of the Kerch Strait.\n\nThe ministry later wrote on Telegram that efforts to evacuate the crew of the second ship, Volganeft 239, were suspended because of bad weather.\n\nThe ministry said rescue teams were in contact with the ship, which had all facilities on board necessary to ensure the lives of the crew were not in danger.\n\nOfficial statements did not provide details on the extent of the spill or why one of the tankers sustained such serious damage.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin ordered the government to set up a working group to deal with the rescue operation and mitigate the impact of the fuel spill, news agencies cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying, after Putin met with the ministers for emergencies and environment.\n\nSvetlana Radionova, head of Russia's natural resources watchdog Rosprirodnadzor, said specialists were assessing the damage at the site of the incident.\n\n— With additional input from Reuters"

Kyiv is also trying to build ties with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, whose promise to end the war swiftly has raised concerns in Ukraine that it could be largely on Moscow’s terms.\n\nUkraine’s Khortytsiya military command said on Saturday that Russian troops had destroyed several Ukrainian positions in villages around Pokrovsk, improving their tactical positions after “exhausting battles” and forcing Kyiv forces to retreat. In its daily report, the Ukrainian military reported a total of 62 combat clashes near Pokrovsk in the last 24 hours. Ukrainian officials said that about 11,000 people still remain in Pokrovsk, which has been under constant shelling for months and where all critical infrastructure - electricity, water, and gas supplies were destroyed.\n\nPokrovsk lies at the intersection of several important roads and rail lines and is just about 20 kilometres away from the administrative border of the Donetsk region. Moscow has been trying to reach that line since the start of the invasion, as its forces aim to seize all of Donetsk and Luhansk regions.\n\nMilitary analysts said that for Kyiv, losing Pokrovsk would also potentially mean having the war closer to central Ukraine and its better-protected rear."

        "full_content": "Rebels led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham drive a military vehicle in al-Rashideen, Aleppo province, Syria November 29, 2024. — Reuters\n\nMOSCOW: Russia has established direct contacts with the political committee of Syria’s Islamist rebel group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Interfax news agency quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov as saying on Thursday.\n\nInterfax reported that Bogdanov, speaking to journalists, also said that Moscow aimed to maintain its military bases in Syria to continue “fighting international terrorism”.\n\nBogdanov said contacts with HTS, the most powerful force in the country after the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad, were “proceeding in constructive fashion”.\n\nRussia, he said, hoped the group would fulfil its pledges to “guard against all excesses”, maintain order and ensure the safety of diplomats and other foreigners.\n\nBogdanov said Russia hoped to maintain its two bases in Syria - a naval base in Tartous and the Khmeimim Air Base near the port city of Latakia - to keep up efforts against international terrorism. “The bases are still there, where they were on Syrian territory. No other decisions have been made for the moment,” he was quoted as saying.\n\n“They were there at the Syrians’ request with the aim of fighting terrorists from the Islamic State. I am proceeding on the basis of the notion that everyone agrees that the fight against terrorism, and what remains of IS, is not over.”\n\nMaintaining that fight, he said, “requires collective efforts and in this connection, our presence and the Khmeimim base played an important role in the context of the overall fight against international terrorism.”\n\nFive Russian warships, including three frigates and at least one submarine, were photographed in Tartus port last week but had left by Monday.\n\nThe warships were in a holding pattern 10 miles off the Syrian coast, out of range of rebel artillery and drone attacks, images released by US-based Maxar showed.\n\nMarineTraffic data also showed no ship had docked at or left Tartus since Monday. Moscow has not commented, but well-connected military bloggers and propagandists confirmed the Kremlin had withdrawn its warship from Tartus.\n\nSources have also said that Moscow withdrew its warplanes from the Khmeimim Air Base, 75 miles north of Tartus, while it opened negotiations with HTS commanders.\n\nAnastasia Kashevarova, a pro-war Russian propagandist, told her 250,000 Telegram followers that rebel fighters had surrounded Russia’s bases in Syria.\n\n“Currently, negotiations on Syria are underway between Russia, Turkey, Iran and others,” she said. “The issue of Russian military bases in Syria is open.”\n\nPutin is desperate to retain control of its military bases in Syria, where Moscow intervened to prop up Assad during the civil war in 2015.\n\nThe Tartus Naval Base has been the lynchpin for Russia’s operations in the Mediterranean Sea and across Africa. It is the only naval base in the region that the Kremlin independently controls and has been its main “replenishment and repair” centre. Analysts have said that the Kremlin had also maintained a “well-armed naval squadron” at Tartus.\n\nBuilt by the Soviet Union in 1971, Putin expanded Tartus in 2015 after his intervention in Syria to challenge the West in Africa, where he has since encouraged a series of coups by client rebel commanders and deployed mercenaries.\n\nThe Khmeimim Air Base played an important role in defeating rebels in 2015. Russian forces launched carpet bombing missions from the base, killing thousands of civilians and destroying rebel positions."

The sides agreed to hold online meetings between the companies in the first quarter of 2025 with a view to potentially entering MoUs on further cooperation.\n\nThe sides were informed about the interest of Gazprom PJSC to investigate opportunities of LNG supplies from Portovaya LNG plant (the existing LNG production complex near the Portovaya compressor station in the Leningrad Region) to Pakistan.\n\nThe Russian side noted the interest of PJSC NOVATEK in developing cooperation with Pakistani partners in the gas sector and ready to discuss LNG supplies with them as well as participation in integrated gas projects in Pakistan. The sides expressed their interest in organizing long-term LNG supplies from the project of “Gas processing complex within Ust-Luga ethane-rich gas processing cluster” to Pakistan.\n\nThe Pakistani side informed that a detailed study has been initiated regarding the assessment of energy demand and supply. Based on the outcome of the study, the Pakistani side will be in a better position to decide on the purchase of LNG. The Pakistani side will share the results of the study on completion by third quarter of 2025. The sides supported the negotiations between RusChemAlliance (project operator) and Pakistan LNG Limited (PLL) and signing of long-term agreement for LNG supplies from the Project to Pakistan, taking into consideration the results of the study.\n\nThe Pakistani side presented the investment opportunities for oil and gas exploration in offshore Pakistan. The Russian side requested to share technical details in order to develop dialogue on this matter. The details of offshore opportunities were shared and a follow up meeting was held with Zarubezhneft JSC and Pakistani E&P companies, part of the delegation. Further engagement on offshore exploration and onshore mature fields was agreed between Zarubezhneft JSC and OGDCL, PPL and MPCL.\n\nThe Russian side noted the interest of Rosgeo JSC in enhancing cooperation in the field of geology and diversification of the mineral resource base of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

        "full_content": "Chinese President Xi Jinping attends a presentation ceremony in Beijing, China September 29, 2024. — Reuters\n\nPresident Xi Jinping, during his address at the ‘BRICS Plus’ leaders’ dialogue in Kazan Russia on October 24, 2024, called upon the countries of the Global South to “support each other in taking the path to moderniaation” and announced the formation of a Global South Think Tanks Alliance to “promote people-to-people exchanges and experience-sharing”.\n\nPoliticians and policymakers of the developing countries were quick to heed the call coming from the leader of a country that has accounted for close to three-quarters of global poverty reduction since 1980. In Nanjing in China’s Jiangsu province, during a historic conclave of political leaders and representatives of think tanks from over 100 countries, the Global South Think Tanks Alliance was officially launched on Thursday, November 14, 2024.\n\nThis pool of resources from more than 200 universities and institutions from China and other developing counties will investigate, among others, the reasons behind the failures of Western theories of development and globalisation and conduct research to highlight how each developing country can forge its own unique path of modernisation, as demonstrated by the success of China.\n\nAfter World War I, the establishment of the Bretton Woods institutions and the UN system inaugurated the first-ever global security and economic order. However, the emergence of the USSR as an ideological rival prevented the US from exercising uncontested hegemony. All this changed when the curtain fell on the Soviet Union in December 1991. All international institutions were now under the political and ideological sway of the US and its European allies.\n\nFor the next quarter century, the West purveyed its values, political institutions, economic models, security organisations, and cultural norms as the inexorable destiny of all mankind. No society could find stability, develop economically, or make social progress except within the framework of liberal democracy, market economy, and Western notions of freedom and human rights.\n\nRussia, other republics of the former Soviet Union, and nations of Eastern Europe were the first to experience the transformation of their societies in the ‘new world order’. These countries were cajoled and coerced by Washington into accepting the ‘shock therapy’ of disarmament, denuclearisation, democratisation, privatisation, and wholesale deregulation and liberalisation. The results were less than salubrious.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia, the biggest member state of the now-defunct Warsaw Pact countries, underwent an economic contraction worse than the one faced by the US during the Great Depression. It experienced a decade of political chaos, hyper-inflation, unemployment, breakdown of internal security, and disintegration of the moral fabric of society. The Russian population has been declining ever since.\n\nCountries in Africa, Latin America, and Asia were made to follow the same set of policies through soft and hard power tactics. After nearly three decades, the results outside Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States are even less encouraging. Economically, countries in Latin America have either regressed or remain stagnant. Politically multi-party democracy has failed to flourish on the continent.\n\nDuring the same period, Africa’s share of the poor population of the world has risen from 56 per cent to over 67 per cent despite more than $2 trillion in development assistance according to some estimates. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to more failed states than any other part of the world. Only in East and Southeast Asia have countries succeeded in achieving regional peace, domestic stability, and economic progress. This has been made possible not by copying the Western template but by deviating from it in terms of ideology, institutional arrangements, and policy framework.\n\nChina is the most notable example of this East Asian exceptionalism. Since the reform and opening up beginning in 1978, China has modernised and engaged with the outside world without succumbing to the Western model of development and global integration. China reestablished relations with the World Bank and the IMF in 1980 but has avoided falling into a debt trap or requiring financial bailouts.\n\nIn the late 1980s, despite extreme national and international pressure, China wisely resisted calls for Western-style democracy. Ignoring the policy advice of multilateral institutions for en masse privatisation, China successfully incentivised and made its state-owned enterprises (SOE) profitable. Similarly, it protected its industrial base while successfully integrating into the global economy following accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001.\n\nMost significantly, China rejected the West’s trickle-down economic theories and employed state machinery to divert resources towards less developed regions, sectors, and population groups. As a result, while other countries faltered, China succeeded in lifting nearly 800 million people out of poverty.\n\nChina’s economic success has shattered the spell of Western ideological hegemony and opened new possibilities for developing countries to pursue policies that suit their social, political, and historic realities. These nations, a majority of whom are falling short in their goal to end extreme poverty by 2030, can draw encouragement from the example of China which has met the poverty reduction target of the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development ahead of schedule.\n\nChina’s continuing modernisation drive since the election of Xi Jinping to the post of general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) by the 18th National Congress in 2012 has defied the West’s ‘end of history’ thesis and proved wrong its predictions that economic growth would either turn China into a mirror image of Western society or the country would face social unrest and implode economically. The Western argument that multi-party adult franchise democracy and laissez-faire economic policies provide the sole pathway to prosperity no longer appears persuasive.\n\nThe rise of China is not just characterised by strategic autonomy but also by humility, the principle of non-interference, and strategic restraint. While China has displayed leadership by initiating the Global South Think Tanks Dialogue and forming an alliance of research institutions from more than one hundred countries, it has no desire to export its political institutions and economic model. China only functions as a mirror. It is for the public intellectuals of the Global South to ponder why their societies are falling behind despite being the poster children of Western globalisation while China has succeeded in rejuvenating its civilisation by following a path forged by its people and history.\n\nThe message of President Xi Jinping to the Global South, delivered at the G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro on November 18, can serve as a source of inspiration: “if China can make it, other developing countries can make it too”.\n\nThe writer is the chairperson of Crescent Foundation, Pakistan."

The official also said the weapon has a smaller warhead than other missiles Russia has deployed in Ukraine."

Whelan was eventually freed as part of the Aug 1 deal.\n\nBut Trump was critical of one prisoner swap brokered between Washington and Moscow, in which Brittney Griner, an American basketball player being held by Russia, was traded for notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.\n\nThe president-elect said the deal was “stupid” and “unpatriotic”, claiming it favoured Russian interests.\n\nThere are still many Westerners lingering in Russian prisons, even after the latest exchange, who could be traded as part of a deal between Trump and Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president.\n\nMarc Fogel, a Pennsylvania native, was arrested entering Russia in 2021, before being sentenced to 14 years in prison for drug smuggling. The history teacher was allegedly carrying a small amount of cannabis.\n\nKsenia Karelina, a Russian-American dual citizen, was detained in February, accused of treason over a $52 donation to a Ukrainian charity in the US.\n\nAnd in July, Michael Travis Leake, an American rock musician, was sentenced to 13 years in jail after being accused of organising a drug-trafficking ring.\n\nRussia is said to maintain a list of at least 70 of its citizens being held in US jails, convicted of crimes like espionage or sanctions evasion.\n\nMash, a Telegram channel with links to Russia’s security services, reported that a swap could happen as early as February next year."

        "full_content": "A tank is parked on a street after Syrian rebels announced that they have ousted Syria's Bashar al-Assad, in Damascus, Syria, December 8, 2024. — Reuters\n\nSyrians awakened on Monday to a mix of hope and uncertainty after rebels captured Damascus and President Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia, ending a 13-year civil war and over 50 years of the al-Assad family's brutal rule.\n\nThe rapid advance of Hayat al-Tahir al-Shams (HTS), a former al-Qaeda affiliate, marked a key turning point in the region as Assad's departure weakened Iran and Russia's influence in the Arab world.\n\nMoscow gave asylum to Assad and his family, Russian media reported and Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's ambassador to international organisations in Vienna, said on his Telegram channel on Sunday.\n\nInternational governments welcomed the end of the Assad's autocratic government, as they sought to take stock of a new-look Middle East.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden said Syria is in a period of risk and uncertainty, and it is the first time in years that neither Russia, Iran, nor the Hezbollah organisation held an influential role there.\n\nHTS is still designated as a terrorist group by the US, Turkey, and the United Nations, although it has spent years trying to soften its image to reassure international governments and minority groups within Syria.\n\nJapan's chief cabinet secretary, Yoshimasa Hayashi, said on Monday Tokyo was paying close attention to developments in Syria.\n\nAssad's overthrow limits Iran's ability to spread weapons to its allies and could cost Russia its Mediterranean naval base. It could also allow millions of refugees scattered for more than a decade in camps across Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan to finally return home.\n\nRebuilding Syria\n\nThe rebels face a monumental task of rebuilding and running a country after a war that left hundreds of thousands dead, cities pounded to dust and an economy hollowed by global sanctions. Syria will need billions of dollars in aid.\n\n\"A new history, my brothers, is being written in the entire region after this great victory,\" said Ahmed al-Sharaa, better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the head of HTS.\n\nSpeaking to a huge crowd on Sunday at Damascus' Umayyad Mosque, a place of enormous religious significance, Golani said with hard work Syria would be \"a beacon for the Islamic nation.\"\n\nThe Assad police state was known as one of the harshest in the Middle East with hundreds of thousands of political prisoners held in horrifying conditions.\n\nOn Sunday, elated but often confused inmates poured out of jails. Reunited families wept in joy. Newly freed prisoners were filmed running through the Damascus streets holding up their hands to show how many years they had been in prison.\n\nThe White Helmets rescue organisation said it had dispatched emergency teams to search for hidden underground cells still believed to hold detainees.\n\nWith a curfew declared by the rebels, Damascus was calm overnight, with roads leading into the city mostly empty. One shopping centre had been looted on Sunday, and some people rampaged inside Assad's presidential place, leaving carrying furniture.\n\nThe rebel coalition said it was working to complete the transfer of power to a transitional governing body with executive powers, referring to building \"a Syria together.\"\n\nGolani is a Sunni Muslim, which is the majority in Syria, but the country is home to a wide range of religious sects, including Christians and Assad's fellow Alawites, an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam.\n\nWorld stunned\n\nThe pace of events stunned world capitals and raised concerns about more regional instability on top of the ongoing crises in the Middle East.\n\nThe US Central Command said its forces conducted dozens of airstrikes targeting known Daesh camps and operatives in central Syria on Sunday.\n\nSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said on Sunday he spoke with Turkish Minister of National Defense Yasar Guler, emphasising the importance of protecting civilians and that the US is watching closely.\n\nDuring Syria's civil war, which erupted in 2011 as an uprising against Assad, his forces and their Russian allies bombed cities to rubble. The refugee crisis across the Middle East was one of the biggest of modern times and caused a political reckoning in Europe when a million people arrived in 2015.\n\nIn recent years, Turkey had backed some rebels in a small redoubt in the northwest and along its border. The US, which has about 900 troops in Syria, backed a Kurdish-led alliance that fought Daesh fighters from 2014-2017."
