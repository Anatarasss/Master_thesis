(AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky)\n\nRussia and Ukraine have no direct peace talks scheduled, the Kremlin said Thursday, nearly a week after their first face-to-face session since shortly after Moscow’s invasion in 2022 and days after U.S. President Donald Trump said they would start ceasefire negotiations “immediately.”\n\n“There is no concrete agreement about the next meetings,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “They are yet to be agreed upon.”\n\nDuring two hours of talks in Istanbul on May 16, Kyiv and Moscow agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war each, in what would be their biggest such swap. Apart from that step, the meeting delivered no significant breakthrough.\n\nSeveral months of intensified U.S. and European pressure on the two sides to accept a ceasefire and negotiate a settlement have yielded little progress. Meanwhile, Russia is readying a summer offensive to capture more Ukrainian land, Ukrainian government and military analysts say.\n\nPutin’s proposals\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said earlier this week that Moscow would “propose and is ready to work with” Ukraine on a “memorandum” outlining the framework for “a possible future peace treaty.” Putin has effectively rejected a 30-day ceasefire proposal that Ukraine has accepted. He has linked the possibility to a halt in Ukraine’s mobilization effort and a freeze on Western arms shipments to Kyiv as part of a comprehensive settlement.\n\nEuropean leaders have accused Putin of dragging his feet in peace efforts while he tries to press his bigger army’s battlefield initiative and capture more Ukrainian land.\n\nThe major prisoner swap is a “quite laborious process” that “requires some time,” Peskov said.\n\nBut he added: “The work is continuing at a quick pace, everybody is interested in doing it quickly.”\n\nPeskov told Russia’s Interfax news agency that Moscow had provided Kyiv with a list of prisoners it wants released. “We have not yet received a counter list from Kyiv. We are waiting,” he told Interfax.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that preparations are underway for the potential prisoner exchange, which he described as “perhaps the only real result” of the talks in Turkey.\n\nPeskov disputed a report Thursday in The Wall Street Journal that Trump told European leaders after his phone call with Putin on Monday that the Russian leader wasn’t interested in talks because he thinks that Moscow is winning.\n\n“We know what Trump told Putin, we don’t know what Trump told the Europeans. We know President Trump’s official statement,” Peskov said. “What we know contrasts with what was written in the article you mentioned.”\n\nRussian capital targeted by drones for the second night\n\nApart from the continuing war of attrition along the roughly 1,000-kilometre (620-mile) front line, which has killed tens of thousands of troops on both sides, Russia and Ukraine have been firing dozens of long-range drones at each other’s territory almost daily.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said it shot down 105 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 35 over the Moscow region. It was the second straight night that Kyiv’s forces have targeted the Russian capital.\n\nMore than 160 flights were delayed at three of Moscow’s four main airports, the city’s transport prosecutor said, as officials grounded planes citing concerns for passenger safety.\n\nThe attack prompted some regions to turn off mobile internet signals, including the Oryol region southwest of Moscow, which was targeted heavily Wednesday.\n\nThe Defense Ministry claimed it downed 485 Ukrainian drones over several regions and the Black Sea between late Tuesday and early Thursday, including 63 over the Moscow region, in one of the biggest drone attacks.\n\nIt was not possible to verify the numbers.\n\nRussia seeks a buffer zone on the border\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian air force said Russia launched 128 drones overnight. Among the targets were Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region, damaging an industrial facility, power lines, and several private homes, regional Gov. Serhii Lysak said on Telegram.\n\nIn Kyiv, debris from a Russian drone fell onto the grounds of a school in the capital’s Darnytskyi district, according to Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration. No injuries were reported.\n\nUkrainian shelling in Russia’s Kursk region killed a 50-year-old man and injured two others, acting regional Gov. Alexander Khinshtein said Thursday.\n\nPutin visited the Kursk region on Tuesday for the first time since Moscow claimed that it drove Ukrainian forces out of the area last month. Kyiv officials denied the claim.\n\n“Despite the liberation of our territory, the border region is still subject to enemy attacks,” Khinshtein warned residents on Telegram. “It is still dangerous to be there.”\n\nPutin has said Russian forces have orders to create a “security buffer zone” along the border.\n\nThat would help prevent Ukraine from striking areas inside Russia with artillery, Putin told a government meeting, but he gave no details of where the proposed buffer zone would be or how far it would stretch.\n\nPutin said a year ago that a Russian offensive at the time aimed to create a buffer zone in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region. That could have helped protect Russia’s Belgorod border region, where frequent Ukrainian attacks have embarrassed the Kremlin."

A northern Manitoba man who went to fight alongside the Ukrainian army has died, the chief of Opaskwayak Cree Nation said Tuesday. (Handout, Faith Lathlin-Bercier/The Canadian Press)\n\nA Manitoba man killed while fighting for Ukraine against Russia will be recognized posthumously on Wednesday.\n\nThe Ukrainian Canadian Congress and the Ukrainian War Veterans Association of Canada will present the Ukrainian Canadian Sacrifice Medal to the family of Austin Lathlin-Bercier during a ceremony at the Manitoba legislative building.\n\nJoanne Lewandosky, president of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress – Manitoba Provincial Council, said Lathlin-Bercier‘s mother, Lucy Bercier, will be receiving the medal on her son’s behalf.\n\nLathlin-Bercier, who was from Opaskwayak Cree Nation, was killed in combat in November 2023 in Avdiivka, Donetsk Oblast. He was 25 years old.\n\n“We, the Ukrainian community, are so proud of this Manitoba, young Indigenous boy who saw at the age of 25 to do what his heart asked him to do, and, in the end, we have to remember the 25-year-old Austin who gave his life for Ukraine,” Lewandosky said.\n\nLathlin-Bercier had volunteered with Ukraine’s International Legion in March 2022. He had training with the Canadian Armed Forces in its Cadet and Bold Eagle program, which combined Indigenous teachings and military training.\n\nTaras Jackiw, the sacrifice medal committee chairperson from the Ukrainian War Veterans Association of Canada, has handed out five of these medals to Canadians who have been killed or wounded in action while fighting for Ukraine against Russia.\n\nUkrainian Canadian Sacrifice Medal A close-up of the Ukrainian Canadian Sacrifice Medal that will be given to the family of Austin Lathlin-Bercier who was killed in combat in Ukraine. (Michelle Gerwing/CTV News Winnipeg)\n\nHe said Lathlin-Bercier‘s story is unique because he was an Indigenous man from a northern Manitoba First Nation.\n\n“The way we understand it, he was in Europe when the war started, and he contacted his mother and said, ‘I have to go fight for the defence of women and children,’” Jackiw said.\n\n“It’s just amazing that someone from there would understand and make a connection with the Ukrainian community in Manitoba and in Ukraine and was willing to defend it.\n\nJackiw added that of all the medal recipients, only one had Ukrainian blood.\n\n“It’s almost to the level of believing in what is right and believing in the democratic values and freedom for everyone,” he said. “Regardless of where in the world they believe that is important, and they will defend that.”\n\nThe medal features four Canadian maple leaves and the Ukrainian trident. Lathlin-Bercier‘s name and the date of his passing are engraved on the back.\n\nAt the time of his death, Opaskwayak Cree Nation Chief and Council issued a statement of condolences to his family.\n\n“By all accounts, Austin was bright, compassionate, and extremely brave,” Chief Maureen Brown wrote.\n\nThe statement went into Lathlin-Bercier‘s life, saying he left the community to teach English in Peru and he had been in Italy and Romania when the war broke out in Ukraine. He enlisted right away.\n\n“The way he lived his life unselfishly and for others is a beacon of bravery for such a young man. He lived and offered his life with honour. He made our nation proud.”\n\nChief Brown commended his parents and other family members for raising a strong and compassionate man.\n\n“His life, light and sacrifice will never be forgotten.”\n\n-With files from The Canadian Press"

(Russian Presidential Press Service via AP)\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin visited Russia’s Kursk region for the first time since Moscow claimed that it drove Ukrainian forces out of the area last month, the Kremlin said Wednesday.\n\nPutin visited the region bordering Ukraine the previous day, according to the Kremlin.\n\nUkrainian forces made a surprise incursion into Kursk in August 2024 in one of their biggest battlefield successes in the more than three-year war. The incursion was the first time Russian territory was occupied by an invader since World War II and dealt a humiliating blow to the Kremlin.\n\nSince the end of 2023, Russia has mostly had the advantage on the battlefield, with the exception of Kursk.\n\nPutin has effectively rejected recent U.S. and European proposals for a ceasefire. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday accused Kyiv’s allies of seeking a truce “so that they can calmly arm Ukraine, so that Ukraine can strengthen its defensive positions.”\n\nNorth Korea sent up to 12,000 troops to help the Russian army take back control of Kursk, according to Ukraine, the U.S. and South Korea. Russia announced on April 26 that its forces had pushed out the Ukrainian army. Kyiv officials denied the claim.\n\nUkraine says it stopped Russian attacks in Kursk\n\nThe Ukrainian Army General Staff said Wednesday that its forces repelled 13 Russian assaults in Kursk. Its map of military activity showed Ukrainian troops holding a thin line of land hard against the border but still inside Russia.\n\nPutin’s unannounced visit appeared to be an effort to show Russia is in control of the conflict, even though its full-scale invasion of its neighbor has been slow and costly in terms of casualties and equipment.\n\nVideo broadcast by Russian state media showed that Putin visited Kursk Nuclear Power Plant-2, which is still under construction, and met with selected volunteers behind closed doors.\n\nMany of the volunteers wore clothes emblazoned with the Russian flag and the Latin letters “Z” and “V”, which are symbols of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“What you are doing now during this difficult situation for this region, for this area, and for the country, will remain with you for the rest of your life as, perhaps, the most meaningful thing with which you were ever involved,” Putin said as he drank tea with the volunteers.\n\nUkraine’s surprise thrust into Kursk and its ability to hold land there was a logistical feat, carried out in secrecy, that countered months of gloomy news from the front about Ukrainian forces being pushed backward by the bigger Russian army.\n\nKyiv’s strategy aimed to show that Russia has weaknesses and that the war isn’t lost. It also sought to distract Russian forces from their onslaught in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine.\n\nThe move was fraught with risk. Analysts noted that it could backfire and open a door for Russian advances in Ukraine by further stretching Ukrainian forces that are short-handed along the roughly 1,000-kilometre (620-mile) front line.\n\nThe incursion didn’t significantly change the dynamics of the war.\n\nPutin told acting Kursk Gov. Alexander Khinshtein that the Kremlin supported the idea of continuing monthly payments to displaced families that still couldn’t return to their homes.\n\nPutin said that he would back a proposal to build a museum in the region to celebrate what acting Gov. Alexander Khinshtein described as “the heroism of our defenders and the heroism of the region’s residents.”\n\nDisgruntled residents had previously shown their disapproval over a lack of compensation in rare organized protests.\n\nPutin last visited the Kursk region in March, when Ukrainian troops still controlled some parts of the area. He wore military fatigues -- a rarely seen sight for the Russian leader, who usually wears a suit -- and visited the area’s military headquarters where he was filmed with top generals.\n\nRussia and Ukraine continue deep strikes with drones\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Defense said that its air defenses shot down 159 Ukrainian drones across the country overnight, including 53 over the Oryol region and 51 over the Bryansk region.\n\nFlights were temporarily grounded twice at Moscow’s Domodedovo and Zhukosky airports, according to Russia’s Federal Air Transport Agency, or Rosaviatsiya, as officials reported Ukrainian drones being shot down in the area.\n\nIn Ukraine, Russian drone attacks killed two people and wounded five others in the northern Sumy region, the regional administration said.\n\nIn the Kyiv region, four members of a family were injured when debris from a downed drone hit their home, according to the regional administration.\n\nRussia launched 76 Shahed and decoy drones overnight at Ukraine, the Ukrainian air force said.\n\nThe Ukrainian army said that its drones struck a semiconductor plant overnight in Russia’s Oryol region, about 150 kilometres (90 miles) northeast of Ukraine. According to the General Staff, 10 drones hit the Bolkhov Semiconductor Devices Plant, one of Russia’s key producers of microelectronics for the military-industrial complex.\n\nIt wasn’t possible to independently verify the claim."

The incursion was the first time Russian territory was occupied by an invader since World War II and dealt a humiliating blow to the Kremlin.\n\nSince the end of 2023, Russia has mostly had the advantage on the battlefield, with the exception of Kursk.\n\nUkraine, the U.S. and South Korea said that North Korea sent up to 12,000 troops to help the Russian army take back control of Kursk, and Russia said on April 26 that its forces had pushed out the Ukrainian army. Kyiv officials denied the claim.\n\nPutin’s unannounced visit appeared to be an effort to show Russia is in control of the conflict — even though its full-scale invasion of its neighbor has been slow and costly in terms of casualties and equipment — amid recent U.S. and European proposals for a ceasefire that Putin has effectively rejected.\n\nVideo broadcast by Russian state media showed that Putin visited Kursk Nuclear Power Plant-2, which is still under construction, and met with selected volunteers behind closed doors.\n\nMany of the volunteers wore clothes emblazoned with the Russian flag and the Latin letters “Z” and “V”, which are symbols of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“What you are doing now during this difficult situation for this region, for this area, and for the country, will remain with you for the rest of your life as, perhaps, the most meaningful thing with which you were ever involved,” Putin said as he drank tea with the volunteers.\n\nUkraine's surprise thrust into Kursk and its ability to hold land there was a logistical feat, carried out in secrecy, that countered months of gloomy news from the front about Ukrainian forces being pushed backward by the bigger Russian army.\n\nKyiv's strategy aimed to show that Russia has weaknesses and that the war isn't lost. It also sought to distract Russian forces from their onslaught in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine.\n\nThe move was fraught with risk. Analysts noted that it could backfire and open a door for Russian advances in Ukraine by further stretching Ukrainian forces that are short-handed along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line.\n\nThe incursion didn’t significantly change the dynamics of the war.\n\nPutin told acting Gov. Alexander Khinshtein that the Kremlin supported the idea of continuing monthly payments to displaced families that still couldn't return to their homes.\n\nPutin said that he would back a proposal to build a museum in the region to celebrate what acting Gov. Alexander Khinshtein described as “the heroism of our defenders and the heroism of the region’s residents.”\n\nDisgruntled residents had previously shown their disapproval over a lack of compensation in rare organized protests.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Defense said that its air defenses shot down 159 Ukrainian drones across the country overnight, including 53 over the Oryol region and 51 over the Bryansk region.\n\nIn Ukraine, Russian drone attacks killed two people and wounded five others in the northern Sumy region, the regional administration said.\n\nIn the Kyiv region, four members of a family were injured when debris from a downed drone hit their home, according to the regional administration.\n\nRussia launched 76 Shahed and decoy drones overnight at Ukraine, the Ukrainian air force said.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nThe Associated Press"

The incursion was the first time Russian territory was occupied by an invader since World War II and dealt a humiliating blow to the Kremlin.\n\nSince the end of 2023, Russia has mostly had the advantage on the battlefield, with the exception of Kursk.\n\nUkraine, the U.S. and South Korea said that North Korea sent up to 12,000 troops to help the Russian army take back control of Kursk, and Russia said on April 26 that its forces had pushed out the Ukrainian army. Kyiv officials denied the claim.\n\nPutin’s unannounced visit appeared to be an effort to show Russia is in control of the conflict — even though its full-scale invasion of its neighbor has been slow and costly in terms of casualties and equipment — amid recent U.S. and European proposals for a ceasefire that Putin has effectively rejected.\n\nVideo broadcast by Russian state media showed that Putin visited Kursk Nuclear Power Plant-2, which is still under construction, and met with selected volunteers behind closed doors.\n\nMany of the volunteers wore clothes emblazoned with the Russian flag and the Latin letters “Z” and “V”, which are symbols of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“What you are doing now during this difficult situation for this region, for this area, and for the country, will remain with you for the rest of your life as, perhaps, the most meaningful thing with which you were ever involved,” Putin said as he drank tea with the volunteers.\n\nUkraine's surprise thrust into Kursk and its ability to hold land there was a logistical feat, carried out in secrecy, that countered months of gloomy news from the front about Ukrainian forces being pushed backward by the bigger Russian army.\n\nKyiv's strategy aimed to show that Russia has weaknesses and that the war isn't lost. It also sought to distract Russian forces from their onslaught in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine.\n\nThe move was fraught with risk. Analysts noted that it could backfire and open a door for Russian advances in Ukraine by further stretching Ukrainian forces that are short-handed along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line.\n\nThe incursion didn’t significantly change the dynamics of the war.\n\nPutin told acting Gov.

        "full_content": "FILE - An oil tanker is moored at the Sheskharis complex, part of Chernomortransneft JSC, a subsidiary of Transneft PJSC, in Novorossiysk, Russia, on Oct. 11, 2022, one of the largest facilities for oil and petroleum products in southern Russia. (AP Photo, File)\n\nThe EU and Britain announced new sanctions against Russia on Tuesday without waiting for the United States to join them, a day after President Donald Trump spoke to Vladimir Putin without winning a promise for a ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\nLondon and Brussels said their new measures would zero in on Moscow’s “shadow fleet” of oil tankers and financial companies that have helped it avoid the impact of other sanctions imposed over the war.\n\nBut the new measures were announced without corresponding steps from Washington, despite intense public lobbying from leaders of European countries for the Trump administration to join them.\n\nThe leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland had jointly traveled to Kyiv earlier this month and said they had new sanctions against Russia ready to go. European leaders then phoned Trump on the eve of his call with Putin to call for him to join them in imposing tougher measures.\n\nRussia and Ukraine held their first direct talks in more than three years on Friday but failed to agree a ceasefire.\n\nUkraine says it is ready for an immediate ceasefire proposed by Trump, while Russia says it wants talks first. The Europeans say this is proof that Putin, who started the war by invading his neighbor in 2022, is not prepared to end it.\n\n“Putin is clearly playing for time, unfortunately we have to say Putin is not really interested in peace,” Germany’s Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said.\n\n‘Push Putin to end his fantasy’\n\nAfter announcing their measures on Tuesday, Brussels and London both suggested that more sanctions could still follow, making clear they have not given up hope of persuading Washington to act.\n\nFrance’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot called for “sanctions that are truly dissuasive.”\n\n“Let us push Vladimir Putin to put an end to his imperialist fantasy,” he said.\n\nBritain’s Foreign Minister David Lammy said “delaying peace efforts will only redouble our resolve to help Ukraine to defend itself and use our sanctions to restrict Putin’s war machine.”\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said more sanctions were “in the works.”\n\n“The longer Russia wages war, the tougher our response,” she wrote on X.\n\nThe latest sanctions are aimed mainly at cracking down on a shipping fleet that Russia uses to export oil, circumventing a $60 a barrel price cap imposed by the G7 group of industrialized countries to limit Russia’s income.\n\nBritain and the EU said they would also work to lower the cap, which imposes far less of a discount on Russian oil now that global prices have fallen this year.\n\nBut the EU’s Kallas made clear that action was needed from the United States.\n\n“We all agreed and said ... that if they don’t agree to unconditional ceasefire, like Ukraine has agreed over 60 days ago, there will be strong action,” Kallas said. “And that is what we want to see from all the parties who have said that they will act in accordance.”\n\nTrump said on Monday that Russia and Ukraine were ready to start negotiations. Putin said the process would take time.\n\nReporting by Julia Payne, Bart Meijer, Andrew Gray, Lili Bayer and Sam Tabahriti.\n\nAdditional reporting by John Irish.

The measures were endorsed by EU foreign ministers in Brussels.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that while President Vladimir “Putin feigns interest in peace, more sanctions are in the works. Russia’s actions and those who enable Russia face severe consequences.”\n\nRussia uses its “ shadow fleet ” of ships to transport oil and gas, or to carry stolen Ukrainian grain. The EU has now targeted almost 350 of the ships in total.\n\nThe new measures are not obviously linked to Russian delays in agreeing to a ceasefire. Work on the measures began in the days after the last package was finalized three months ago.\n\nUkrainian officials have said that the shadow fleet involves around 500 aging ships of uncertain ownership and safety practices that are dodging sanctions and keeping the oil revenue coming.\n\nRatings agency S&P Global and the Kyiv School of Economics Institute, a think tank, have put the number at over 400 ships that can transport oil, or products made from crude such as diesel fuel and gasoline.\n\nVessels from the shadow fleet have also come under suspicion of damaging undersea cables, particularly in the Baltic Sea. Finnish police on Dec. 26 seized the Eagle S, a tanker they said was part of the dark fleet, on suspicion it used its anchor to damage the Estlink 2 undersea power cable that supplies electricity from Finland to Estonia.\n\nThe EU also said that it targeted people and companies, including an insurer, that make it possible for the shadow fleet to operate, hitting interests in the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Hong Kong.\n\nIn parallel, the U.K. targeted the shadow fleet in a raft of 100 new sanctions that it said are aimed at “ramping up pressure” on the Kremlin.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Britain’s Foreign Office said the sanctions will hit entities supporting Russia’s military, energy exports and information war, as well as financial institutions helping to fund its war against Ukraine.\n\nIt added that the sanctions will target the supply chains of Russian weapons, including Iskander missiles which have been fired into civilian areas in Ukraine during the war. The U.K. will also sanction 18 more ships in the “shadow fleet” carrying Russian oil.\n\n“Putin’s latest strikes once again show his true colors as a warmonger,” Foreign Secretary David Lammy said. “We urge him to agree a full, unconditional ceasefire right away so there can be talks on a just and lasting peace.”\n\nThe EU has slapped several rounds of sanctions on Russia since President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Around 2,400 officials and “entities” — often government agencies, banks and organizations — have been hit.\n\nThe Associated Press"

(AP Photo/Aurelien Morissard, left and center, Pavel Bednyakov, right)\n\nKYIV, Ukraine -- Kyiv’s European allies slapped new sanctions Tuesday on Moscow, a day after a phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to produce a breakthrough on ending the three-year-old war in Ukraine.\n\n“We have made clear again and again that we simply expect one thing from Russia now: namely, a ceasefire, unconditional and immediate,” German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said in addressing the sanctions. “We welcome the fact that Ukraine is still prepared to do this.

In the phone call, Putin promised Trump that Russia is “ready to work with” Ukraine on a “memorandum” outlining the framework for “a possible future peace treaty.”\n\n“It appears that Putin has devised a way to offer Trump an interim, tangible outcome from Washington’s peace efforts without making any real concessions,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre, in a post on X.\n\nRussian media struck a triumphal tone in reporting Putin’s conversation with Trump.\n\nUkrainian leader seeks pressure on Moscow\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on his Telegram channel that “it is obvious that Russia is trying to buy time to continue the war and occupation. We are working with partners to put pressure on the Russians to behave differently.”\n\nThe new European Union sanctions targeted almost 200 ships from Russia’s “shadow fleet” illicitly transporting oil to skirt Western restrictions It also imposed asset freezes and travel bans on several officials as well as on a number of Russian companies.\n\nUkrainian officials have said about 500 aging ships of uncertain ownership and safety practices are dodging sanctions and keeping oil revenues flowing to Moscow.\n\nThe U.K. also targeted the shadow fleet with 100 new sanctions and also aimed at disrupting the supply chains of Russian weapons, officials said.\n\n“Putin’s latest strikes once again show his true colours as a warmonger,” British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said.\n\nBut Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Tuesday: “Russia never responds to ultimatums.”\n\nNo new sanctions on Russia from Trump\n\nTrump has threatened to step up sanctions and tariffs on Russia but hasn’t acted so far.\n\nUkraine has offered a comprehensive 30-day ceasefire, which Moscow has effectively rejected by imposing far-reaching conditions, and Zelenskyy proposed a face-to-face meeting with Putin last week but the Russian leader spurned that offer.\n\nTrump, who had pledged during his campaign to end the war in one day, said his personal intervention was needed to push peace efforts forward. He held separate phone calls with both Putin and Zelenskyy, and said the two countries would “immediately” begin ceasefire negotiations, but there were no details on when or where such talks might take place.\n\n“The status quo has not changed,” Mykhailo Podoliak, a senior adviser to Zelenskyy, wrote on the social platform X on Tuesday.\n\nRussia launched 108 Shahed and decoy drones at Ukraine overnight, the Ukrainian air force said. One drone dropped explosives on a passenger bus in the Dniprovskyi district of the Kherson region, injuring two people, the local administration said.\n\nPutin wants Ukraine to renounce joining NATO, sharply cut its military, and withdraw its forces from the four Ukrainian regions Moscow has seized but doesn’t fully control, among other demands to curb the country’s sovereignty.\n\nAfter the phone call, the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti published an article headlined, “Europe’s hopes crushed: Trump refuses to go to war with Putin.”\n\nIn the pro-Kremlin tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets, columnist Mikhail Rostovsky also portrayed the call as a blow for Ukraine’s European allies.\n\n“Kyiv will agree to a serious, fully fledged conversation with Russia only if it has no other options left.

He later told reporters that he believes “something is going to happen,” but that there are “very big egos involved.”\n\nAnd he said that if a ceasefire is not agreed upon, he would back away, and the war would continue: “This is a European situation. It should have remained a European situation,” he told reporters.\n\nMr. Trump said in his social media post that “Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War. The conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of.”\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Putin told reporters that Russia was ready to work with Ukraine on a “memorandum” about a future peace accord and thanked Mr. Trump for supporting direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nBut Mr. Putin also signalled that Russia was not prepared to make significant concessions: “The main thing for us is to eliminate the root causes of this crisis,” he said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement posted to social media that he spoke with Mr. Trump twice on Monday: once before Mr. Trump’s call with Mr. Putin, and again after the call when Mr. Trump briefed him and other European leaders.\n\n“This is a defining moment. The world can now see whether its leaders are truly capable of securing a ceasefire and achieving real, lasting peace,” Mr. Zelensky wrote. He said he reaffirmed to Mr. Trump that Ukraine is ready for “a full and unconditional ceasefire,” in line with the U.S. President.\n\n“It is important not to dilute this proposal. If the Russians are not ready to stop the killings, there must be stronger sanctions. Pressure on Russia will push it toward real peace – this is obvious to everyone around the world.”\n\nMr. Trump has previously threatened sanctions on Russia and demanded an immediate ceasefire. At other times, he has blamed Ukraine for starting the war. On Monday, he repeatedly said that he believes Mr. Putin wants to end it.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump was asked by reporters why he didn’t increase sanctions on Russia, he said he believes there is a chance of “getting something done,” and that he doesn’t want to make the situation worse.\n\nMr. Zelensky said he also reiterated that Ukraine is ready for direct negotiations with Russia, whether they are facilitated by Turkey, the Vatican or Switzerland.\n\nIn conversation with European leaders, he said, they also discussed possible next steps, such as meetings between negotiators and assessments of each side‘s proposals.\n\n“Every proposal at the table deserves an honest evaluation, that’s why the negotiation process must involve both American and European representatives at the appropriate level,” Mr. Zelensky said.\n\n“It is crucial for all of us that the United States does not distance itself from the talks and the pursuit of peace, because the only one who benefits from that is Putin.”\n\nHe added: “Russia must end the war it started, and it can begin doing so any day. Ukraine has always been ready for peace.”\n\nRussian and Ukrainian officials met in Istanbul last week, marking their first face-to-face meeting since March, 2022. They agreed to a large prisoner exchange but remained at odds on conditions to end Russia’s war.\n\nMr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that the “tone and spirit” of Monday’s conversation with Mr. Putin was excellent, and that if it wasn’t, he would have said so. He said Russia wants to do significant trade with the United States when “this catastrophic ‘bloodbath’ ” is over, and that Ukraine could also benefit.\n\nMr. Trump said the European leaders he briefed after the call were Mr. Zelensky, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Finnish President Alexander Stubb.\n\nRussia has so far rejected calls from Ukraine and its allies to agree to a 30-day ceasefire.\n\nMichael Bociurkiw, global affairs analyst and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said he believes that Mr. Putin’s rhetoric around eliminating “root causes” means that he will string out the war as long as possible and push for the capitulation of Ukraine.\n\nHe said Russia wants to push for its maximalist demands.\n\nFor Russia, that means, among other demands, Ukraine ceding territory, abandoning its ambitions to join NATO, limiting the size of its army and changing its constitution.\n\n“In the meantime, Putin will use this time to continue grabbing more territory but also inflicting as much damage on Ukrainian cities, towns and villages as possible,” Mr. Bociurkiw said.\n\nWith a report from Reuters"

        "full_content": "Roman Waschuk, former Canadian ambassador to Ukraine, weighs in on Trump’s role in the Russia/Ukraine conflict and whether he can sway Putin.\n\nWASHINGTON — Russia and Ukraine will “immediately” begin ceasefire negotiations, U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday after separate calls with the leaders of both countries meant to spur progress toward ending the three-year war. The conversations did not appear to yield a major breakthrough.\n\nIt was not clear when or where any talks might take place or who would participate. Trump’s announcement came days after the first direct engagement between Russian and Ukrainian delegations since 2022. Those negotiations on Friday in Turkey brought about a limited exchange of prisoners but no pause in the fighting.\n\nAhead of the calls, the White House said Trump had grown “frustrated” with both leaders over the continuing war. Vice President JD Vance said Trump would press Russian President Vladimir Putin to see if he was truly interested in stopping the fighting, and if not, that the U.S. could disengage from trying to stop the conflict. Trump later told reporters that he believed Putin was serious about wanting peace.\n\n“The conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of,” Trump said in a social media post.\n\nTrump said the call with Putin was “excellent,” adding, “If it wasn’t, I would say so now, rather than later.”\n\nLater speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, he noted the process has “got very big egos involved, I tell you.”\n\n“Big egos involved. But I think something’s going to happen and, if it doesn’t I’d just back away and they have to keep going,” Trump said. “This was a European situation. It should have remained a European situation.”\n\nTrump also said he told Putin, “We’ve got to get going.”\n\nTrump has struggled to end a war that began with Russia’s invasion in February 2022, a setback for his promises to quickly settle the conflict once he was back in the White House, if not before he took office.\n\n“He’s grown weary and frustrated with both sides of the conflict,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday before the calls. “He has made it clear to both sides that he wants to see a peaceful resolution and ceasefire as soon as possible.”\n\nThe Republican president is banking on the idea that his force of personality and personal history with Putin will be enough to break any impasse over a pause in the fighting. He dangled the prospect of reduced sanctions and increased trade with Russia should the war end.\n\nAfter the call, Putin said Russia was ready to continue discussing an end to the fighting after a “very informative and very frank” conversation with Trump. Putin said the warring countries should “find compromises that would suit all parties.”\n\nMoscow, he said, will “propose and is ready to work with” Ukraine on a “memorandum” outlining the framework for “a possible future peace treaty.”\n\nBut indicating that little had fundamentally changed about his demands, Putin said: “At the same time, I would like to note that, in general, Russia’s position is clear. The main thing for us is to eliminate the root causes of this crisis.”\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that he reaffirmed to Trump that Ukraine is ready for a full and unconditional ceasefire. He urged the international community to maintain pressure on Moscow if it refuses to halt its invasion.\n\n“Ukraine doesn’t need to be persuaded -- our representatives are ready to make real decisions. What’s needed is mirrored readiness from Russia for such result-oriented negotiations.” Zelenskyy said.\n\nTrump and Putin addressed each other by first names\n\nRussian presidential adviser Yuri Ushakov, who previously served as Russian ambassador to the U.S., described the conversation as friendly, with Trump and Putin addressing each other by their first names.\n\n“Trump said, `Vladimir, you can pick up the phone at any time, and I will be happy to answer and speak with you,”' he said.\n\nUshakov also said Trump and Putin could meet face-to-face at some point, but no timeline was set.\n\nPutin and Trump also talked about a Russia-US prisoner exchange, which Ushakov said was “in the works” and envisioned Moscow and Washington releasing nine people each. Ushakov did not offer any other details.\n\nSpeaking before the call, Vance said Trump could walk away from trying to end the war if he feels Putin isn’t serious about negotiation.\n\n“I’d say we’re more than open to walking away,” Vance told reporters before leaving Rome after meeting with Pope Leo XIV.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Russia and Ukraine will “immediately” begin ceasefire negotiations, President Donald Trump said Monday after separate calls with the leaders of both countries meant to spur progress toward ending the three-year war. The conversations did not appear to yield a major breakthrough.\n\nIt was not clear when or where any talks might take place or who would participate. Trump’s announcement came days after the first direct engagement between Russian and Ukrainian delegations since 2022. Those negotiations on Friday in Turkey brought about a limited exchange of prisoners but no pause in the fighting.\n\nAhead of the calls, the White House said Trump had grown “frustrated” with both leaders over the continuing war. Vice President JD Vance said Trump would press Russian President Vladimir Putin to see if he was truly interested in stopping the fighting, and if not, that the U.S. could disengage from trying to stop the conflict. Trump later told reporters that he believed Putin was serious about wanting peace.\n\n“The conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of,” Trump said in a social media post.\n\nTrump said the call with Putin was “excellent,” adding, \"If it wasn’t, I would say so now, rather than later.”\n\nTrump has struggled to end a war that began with Russia’s invasion in February 2022, a setback for his promises to quickly settle the conflict once he was back in the White House, if not before he took office.\n\n“He’s grown weary and frustrated with both sides of the conflict,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday before the calls. “He has made it clear to both sides that he wants to see a peaceful resolution and ceasefire as soon as possible.”\n\nThe Republican president is banking on the idea that his force of personality and personal history with Putin will be enough to break any impasse over a pause in the fighting. He dangled the prospect of reduced sanctions and increased trade with Russia should the war end.\n\nAfter the call, Putin said Russia was ready to continue discussing an end to the fighting after a “very informative and very frank” conversation with Trump. Putin said the warring countries should “find compromises that would suit all parties.\"\n\nMoscow, he said, will “propose and is ready to work with” Ukraine on a “memorandum” outlining the framework for “a possible future peace treaty.”\n\nBut indicating that little had fundamentally changed about his demands, Putin said: “At the same time, I would like to note that, in general, Russia’s position is clear. The main thing for us is to eliminate the root causes of this crisis.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that he reaffirmed to Trump that Ukraine is ready for a full and unconditional ceasefire. He urged the international community to maintain pressure on Moscow if it refuses to halt its invasion.\n\n“Ukraine doesn’t need to be persuaded — our representatives are ready to make real decisions. What’s needed is mirrored readiness from Russia for such result-oriented negotiations.” Zelenskyy said.\n\nTrump and Putin addressed each other by first names\n\nRussian presidential adviser Yuri Ushakov, who previously served as Russian ambassador to the U.S., described the conversation as friendly, with Trump and Putin addressing each other by their first names.\n\n“Trump said, ‘Vladimir, you can pick up the phone at any time, and I will be happy to answer and speak with you,’” he said.\n\nUshakov also said Trump and Putin could meet face-to-face at some point, but no timeline was set.\n\nPutin and Trump also talked about a Russia-US prisoner exchange, which Ushakov said was “in the works” and envisioned Moscow and Washington releasing nine people each. Ushakov did not offer any other details.\n\nSpeaking before the call, Vance said Trump could walk away from trying to end the war if he feels Putin isn’t serious about negotiation.\n\n“I’d say we’re more than open to walking away,” Vance told reporters before leaving Rome after meeting with Pope Leo XIV.

        "full_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Russia and Ukraine will “immediately” begin ceasefire negotiations, President Donald Trump said Monday after separate calls with the leaders of both countries meant to spur progress toward ending the three-year war. The conversations did not appear to yield a major breakthrough.\n\nIt was not clear when or where any talks might take place or who would participate. Trump’s announcement came days after the first direct engagement between Russian and Ukrainian delegations since 2022. Those negotiations on Friday in Turkey brought about a limited exchange of prisoners but no pause in the fighting.\n\nAhead of the calls, the White House said Trump had grown “frustrated” with both leaders over the continuing war. Vice President JD Vance said Trump would press Russian President Vladimir Putin to see if he was truly interested in stopping the fighting, and if not, that the U.S. could disengage from trying to stop the conflict. Trump later told reporters that he believed Putin was serious about wanting peace.\n\n“The conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of,” Trump said in a social media post.\n\nTrump said the call with Putin was “excellent,” adding, \"If it wasn’t, I would say so now, rather than later.”\n\nTrump has struggled to end a war that began with Russia’s invasion in February 2022, a setback for his promises to quickly settle the conflict once he was back in the White House, if not before he took office.\n\n“He’s grown weary and frustrated with both sides of the conflict,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday before the calls. “He has made it clear to both sides that he wants to see a peaceful resolution and ceasefire as soon as possible.”\n\nThe Republican president is banking on the idea that his force of personality and personal history with Putin will be enough to break any impasse over a pause in the fighting. He dangled the prospect of reduced sanctions and increased trade with Russia should the war end.\n\nAfter the call, Putin said Russia was ready to continue discussing an end to the fighting after a “very informative and very frank” conversation with Trump. Putin said the warring countries should “find compromises that would suit all parties.\"\n\nMoscow, he said, will “propose and is ready to work with” Ukraine on a “memorandum” outlining the framework for “a possible future peace treaty.”\n\nBut indicating that little had fundamentally changed about his demands, Putin said: “At the same time, I would like to note that, in general, Russia’s position is clear.

        "full_content": "Pope Leo greeted worshippers before presiding over his inaugural mass. Abigail Bimman has highlights.\n\nU.S. Vice-President JD Vance extended an invitation to Pope Leo XIV to visit the United States during a meeting at the Vatican on Monday ahead of the U.S.-led push for ceasefire negotiations in Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nVance gave the first American pope a letter from U.S. President Donald Trump and the first lady inviting him. The Chicago-born pope took the letter and put it on his desk and was heard saying “at some point,” in the video footage of the meeting provided by Vatican Media.\n\nVance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, also gave the Augustinian pope a copy of two of St. Augustine’s most seminal works, “The City of God” and ”On Christian Doctrine,” the vice-president’s office said. Another gift: A Chicago Bears T-shirt with Leo’s name on it.\n\n“As you can probably imagine, people in the United States are extremely excited about you,” Vance told Leo as they exchanged gifts.\n\nLeo gave Vance a bronze sculpture with the words in Italian “Peace is a fragile flower,” and a coffee-table sized picture book of the papal apartments in the Apostolic Palace. Leo noted that Francis had chosen not to live in them and added, “And I may live in, but it’s not totally decided.”\n\nVance led the U.S. delegation to Sunday’s formal Mass opening the pontificate of the first American pope. Joining him at the meeting on Monday was Secretary of State Marco Rubio, also a Catholic, Vance spokesperson said. The two then also met with the Vatican foreign minister, Archbishop Paul Gallagher.\n\n“There was an exchange of views on some current international issues, calling for respect for humanitarian law and international law in areas of conflict and for a negotiated solution between the parties involved,” according to a Vatican statement after their meeting.\n\nThe White House said Vance and Gallagher “discussed religious freedom, the persecution of Christians around the world and the shared commitment of President Trump and Pope Leo XIV to stop the killing in Ukraine and the Middle East.”\n\nAccording to the photo of the visits released by the Vatican, Leo’s brother, Louis Prevost, a self-described “MAGA-type,” and his wife, Deborah, joined the delegation during the visit.\n\nThe Vatican, which was largely sidelined during the first three years of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has offered to host any peace talks while continuing humanitarian efforts to facilitate prisoner swaps and reunite Ukrainian children taken by Russia.\n\nTrump said Monday that Russia and Ukraine will “immediately” begin ceasefire negotiations after what he described as an “excellent” call with Russian President Vladimir Putin that lasted more than two hours. He noted that the Vatican “as represented by the Pope, has stated that it would be very interested in hosting the negotiations.”\n\n‘Every effort’ on Ukraine\n\nLeo, the former Cardinal Robert Prevost, is a Chicago-born Augustinian missionary who spent the bulk of his ministry in Chiclayo, a commercial city of around 800,000 on Peru’s northern Pacific coast.\n\nBefore his election, Prevost shared news articles on X that were critical of the Trump administration’s plans for mass deportations of migrants.\n\nVance was one of the last foreign officials to meet with Francis before the Argentine pope’s April 21 death. The two had tangled over migration, with Francis publicly rebuking the Trump administration’s deportation plan and correcting Vance’s theological justification for it."
