      "By Associated Press Reporters Russia and Ukraine have scheduled no further direct talks on ending their more than three-year war, a Kremlin spokesman has said.",
      "The comment comes almost a week after the first face-to-face engagement between the countries’ delegations since 2022 and days after US President Donald Trump announced they would start ceasefire negotiations “immediately”.",
      "“There is no concrete agreement about the next meetings,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.",
      "Municipal workers remove the cover that protected a monument of Kyiv legendary founders from Russian missile attacks (Efrem Lukatsky/AP) “They are yet to be agreed upon.” During two hours of talks in Istanbul last Friday, Kyiv and Moscow agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war each, in what would be their biggest such swap.",
      "Apart from that step, the meeting delivered no significant breakthrough.",
      "Several months of intensified US and European pressure on the two sides to accept a ceasefire and negotiate a settlement have yielded little progress.",
      "Meanwhile, Russia is readying a summer offensive to capture more Ukrainian land, Ukrainian government and military analysts say.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier this week that Moscow would “propose and is ready to work with” Ukraine on a “memorandum” outlining the framework for “a possible future peace treaty”.",
      "Mr Putin has effectively rejected a 30-day ceasefire proposal that Ukraine has accepted.",
      "He has linked the possibility to a halt in Ukraine’s mobilisation effort and a freeze on Western arms shipments to Kyiv as part of a comprehensive settlement.",
      "President Donald Trump claimed that Russia was not interested in talks because he thinks Russia is winning (Evan Vucci/AP) European leaders have accused Mr Putin of dragging his feet in peace efforts while he tries to press his bigger army’s battlefield initiative and capture more Ukrainian land.",
      "The major prisoner swap is a “quite laborious process” that “requires some time”, Mr Peskov said.",
      "But he added: “The work is continuing at a quick pace, everybody is interested in doing it quickly.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Thursday that preparations are under way for the potential prisoner exchange, which he described as “perhaps the only real result” of the talks in Turkey.",
      "Mr Peskov disputed a report on Thursday in the Wall Street Journal that Mr Trump told European leaders after his phone call with Mr Putin on Monday that the Russian leader was not interested in talks because he thinks that Russia is winning.",
      "“We know what Trump told Putin, we don’t know what Trump told the Europeans.",
      "We know President Trump’s official statement,” Mr Peskov said.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks during a briefing in Kyiv, Ukraine (Efrem Lukatsky/AP) “What we know contrasts with what was written in the article you mentioned.” Apart from the continuing war of attrition along the roughly 1,000-kilometre (620-mile) front line, which has killed tens of thousands of troops on both sides, the warring parties have been firing dozens of long-range drones at each other’s territory almost daily.",
      "Russia’s Defence Ministry said that it had shot down 105 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 35 over the Moscow region.",
      "It was the second straight night that Kyiv’s forces have targeted the Russian capital.",
      "More than 160 flights were delayed across three of Moscow’s four main airports, the city’s transport prosecutor said, as officials grounded planes citing concerns for passenger safety.",
      "The attack prompted some regions to turn off mobile internet signals, including the Oryol region southwest of Moscow, which was targeted heavily on Wednesday.",
      "The Defence Ministry claimed it downed 485 Ukrainian drones over several regions and the Black Sea between Tuesday evening and Thursday morning, including 63 over the Moscow region, in one of the biggest drone attacks.",
      "It was not possible to verify the numbers.",
      "Firefighters put out the fire following Russia’s drone attack in the Kyiv region (Ukrainian Emergency Service via AP) Meanwhile, the Ukrainian air force said Russia launched 128 drones at Ukraine overnight.",
      "Among the targets were Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region, damaging an industrial facility, power lines, and several private homes, regional governor Serhii Lysak said on Telegram.",
      "In Kyiv, debris from a Russian drone fell onto the grounds of a school in the capital’s Darnytskyi district, according to the head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, Tymur Tkachenko.",
      "No injuries were reported.",
      "Ukrainian shelling in Russia’s Kursk region killed a 50-year-old man and injured two others, acting regional Governor Alexander Khinshtein said on Thursday.",
      "Mr Putin visited the Kursk region on Tuesday for the first time since Moscow claimed that it drove Ukrainian forces out of the area last month.",
      "Kyiv officials denied the claim.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting near Sochi, Russia (Vyacheslav Prokofyev/AP) “Despite the liberation of our territory, the border region is still subject to enemy attacks,” Mr Khinshtein warned residents on Telegram.",
      "“It is still dangerous to be there.” Mr Putin has said Russian forces have orders to create a “security buffer zone” along the border.",
      "That would help prevent Ukraine from striking areas inside Russia with artillery, Mr Putin told a government meeting, but he gave no details of where the proposed buffer zone would be or how far it would stretch."

      "So rather than being the first hero of the space race, Laika was actually sacrificed as cannon fodder on the altar of bungling Soviet hubris and imperialism.",

      "By Mehmet Guzel, Hanna Arhirova and Suzan Fraser, Associated Press Russia and Ukraine are set to hold their first direct peace talks in three years, both countries said, but hopes for a breakthrough remained dim after Russian President Vladimir Putin spurned an offer by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to meet face-to-face in Turkey.",
      "Mr Zelensky said he is sending a team headed by his defence minister from the Turkish capital Ankara to Istanbul to meet a Russian delegation, even though Moscow’s side does not include “anyone who actually makes decisions”.",
      "Few had expected Mr Putin to show up in Turkey, and his absence punctured any hope of significant progress in efforts to end the three-year-old war that was given a push in recent months by the Trump administration and Western European leaders.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky talks to journalists as he arrives at Esenboga airport in Ankara, Turkey (Evgeniy Maloletka/AP) It also raised the prospect of intensified international sanctions on Russia that have been threatened by the West.",
      "Mr Zelensky, speaking to reporters in Ankara where he flew on Thursday after challenging Mr Putin to sit down with him, accused Moscow of not taking efforts to end the war seriously by sending a low-level negotiating team that he described as “a theatre prop”.",
      "His proposal to Mr Putin came after a flurry of manoeuvring last weekend as each side sought a diplomatic advantage.",
      "The head of the Russian delegation, presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, said in Istanbul the representatives were ready to meet Ukrainian officials.",
      "“The task of these direct negotiations with Ukraine is to establish long-term peace sooner or later by eliminating the root causes of this conflict,” he said in a brief statement.",
      "It was not clear when they would meet.",
      "Mr Medinsky said late on Thursday that the Russian delegation would be waiting for Ukrainian officials at 10am on Friday.",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, shakes hands with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky during their meeting at the presidential palace in Ankara (Turkish Presidency via AP) US secretary of state Marco Rubio said he would confer on Friday in Istanbul with Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan and the Ukrainian delegation, adding that the Russian delegation would be meeting with other members of the US team and that he hoped all sides could get together.",
      "“We don’t have high expectations of what will happen tomorrow.",
      "And frankly, at this point, I think it’s abundantly clear that the only way we’re going to have a breakthrough here is between President Trump and President Putin,” Mr Rubio told reporters in Antalya, Turkey, where he was attending a Nato foreign ministers meeting.",
      "Mr Zelensky, who is heading on Friday to a gathering of European officials in Albania, said he had decided to send the delegation to Istanbul to demonstrate to US President Donald Trump that Ukraine wants to end the fighting.",
      "He said the Ukrainian side would be headed by defence minister Rustem Umerov and its aim is “to attempt at least the first steps toward de-escalation, the first steps toward ending the war – namely, a ceasefire”.",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier welcomed Mr Zelensky with an honour guard at the presidential palace in Ankara before the two held talks.",
      "The war has killed tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides and more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians, according to the UN, and continues along the roughly 1,000-kilometre (620-mile) front line.",
      "Russian forces are preparing a fresh military offensive, Ukrainian government and Western military analysts say.",
      "At least five civilians were killed and 29 injured in the past day, according to authorities in five eastern regions of Ukraine where Russia’s army is trying to advance.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, centre left, is welcomed by Turkish officials upon his arrival at Esenboga airport in Ankara, Turkey (Evgeniy Maloletka/AP) The diplomatic manoeuvring began on Saturday when European leaders met Mr Zelensky in Kyiv and urged the Kremlin to agree to a full, unconditional 30-day ceasefire as a first step towards peace.",
      "Mr Putin responded early on Sunday by proposing direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul.",
      "Then came Mr Zelensky’s challenge to Mr Putin for face-to-face talks.",
      "After days of silence, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov finally said on Thursday that Mr Putin had no plans to travel to Istanbul in the next few days.",
      "Mr Trump said he was not surprised that Mr Putin was a no-show.",
      "The US president had pressed for Mr Putin and Mr Zelensky to meet but brushed off Mr Putin’s apparent decision not to attend.",
      "“I didn’t think it was possible for Putin to go if I’m not there,” Mr Trump told reporters at a meeting with business executives in Doha, Qatar, on the third day of his visit to the Middle East.",
      "Mr Trump said a meeting between him and Mr Putin was crucial to break the deadlock.",
      "President Donald Trump smiles backdropped by an MQ-9 Reaper drone before addressing military personnel at the Al Udeid Air Base in Doha, Qatar (Alex Brandon/AP) “I don’t believe anything’s going to happen whether you like it or not, until (Putin) and I get together,” he said on Air Force One while travelling from Doha to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.",
      "“But we’re going to have to get it solved because too many people are dying.” Mr Peskov said Mr Putin has no plans to meet with Mr Trump in the coming days.",
      "Mr Medinsky is leading the Russian team that also includes three other senior officials, the Kremlin said.",
      "Mr Putin also appointed four lower-level officials as “experts” for the talks in Istanbul.",
      "Also absent from the talks were Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and Mr Putin’s foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov, both of whom represented Russia at the talks with the US in Saudi Arabia in March.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia (Alexander Kryazhev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) The top-level Ukrainian delegation included Mr Umerov, foreign minister Andrii Sybiha and the head of the Ukrainian presidential office Andriy Yermak, a Ukrainian official said.",
      "Mr Zelensky will sit at the negotiating table only with Mr Putin, said presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak.",
      "Mr Putin met on Wednesday evening with senior government officials and members of the delegation in preparation for the talks, Mr Peskov said.",
      "Defence minister Andrei Belousov, General Staff chief Valery Gerasimov and National Security Council secretary Sergei Shoigu also attended.",
      "The Kremlin billed Thursday’s talks as a “restart” of peace negotiations that were held in Istanbul in 2022 but quickly fell apart.",
      "Moscow accused Ukraine and the West of wanting to continue fighting, while Kyiv said Russia’s demands amounted to an ultimatum rather than something both sides could agree on.",
      "Russia’s delegation then was also headed by Mr Medinsky.",
      "Mr Putin’s proposal came after more than three months of diplomacy kickstarted by Mr Trump, who promised during his campaign to end the devastating war swiftly – though it has been hard to pull off.",
      "The Trump administration in recent weeks indicated that it might walk away from the peace effort if there was no tangible progress soon.",
      "Mr Sybiha met with US state secretary Marco Rubio and Senator Lindsey Graham on Wednesday night in the Turkish city of Antalya, which is hosting Nato foreign ministers to discuss new defence investment goals as the US shifts its focus to security challenges away from Europe.",
      "Mr Sybiha reaffirmed Ukraine’s support for Mr Trump’s mediation efforts and thanked the US for its continued involvement, urging Moscow to “reciprocate Ukraine’s constructive steps” towards peace.",
      "“So far, it has not,” Mr Sybiha said.",
      "On Thursday morning, Mr Sybiha also met with other European foreign ministers, including his French counterpart Jean-Noel Barrot, who in a post on X reiterated the call for a ceasefire and the threat of “massive sanctions” if Russia does not comply.",
      "“We’re in a very difficult spot right now, and we hope that we can find the steps forward that provide for the end of this war in a negotiated way and the prevention of any war in the future,” Mr Rubio said on Thursday.",
      "British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Putin of “standing in the way of peace”.",
      "“There was only one country that started this conflict – that was Russia.",
      "That was Putin.",
      "There’s only one country now standing in the way of peace – that is Russia, that is Putin,” he said in a visit to Tirana, Albania.",
      "Mr Barrot echoed that sentiment, saying: “In front of Ukrainians there is an empty chair, one that should have been occupied by Vladimir Putin.",
      "“Vladimir Putin is dragging his feet and in all evidence does not want to enter into these peace discussions.”"

      "By Associated Press Reporters US secretary of state Marco Rubio and his Nato counterparts meet in Turkey on Thursday to prepare a pivotal summit of alliance leaders next month that will set the course for future European security as America focuses on challenges elsewhere.",
      "The meeting in the Mediterranean coastal city of Antalya comes amid a flurry of negotiations aimed at producing a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine, including talks in Istanbul that Mr Rubio and president Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff plan to attend on Friday.",
      "Mr Rubio and Mr Witkoff are coming to Turkey after accompanying Mr Trump on portions of his trip to Gulf Arab countries.",
      "On the sidelines of the Nato meeting, Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha met on Wednesday with Mr Rubio, who also is having separate talks with new German foreign minister Johann Wadephul and foreign minister Hakan Fidan of Turkey, whose country is trying to help broker a deal that might end the more than three-year-old war.",
      "Mr Sybiha and Mr Fidan on Wednesday discussed efforts to establish a ceasefire and steps toward securing a lasting peace with Russia, according to the Turkish foreign ministry.",
      "The same day that Nato foreign ministers gather, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara.",
      "It is an open question whether Mr Trump or Russian President Vladimir Putin will participate on Thursday.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (Evgeniy Maloletka/AP) Mr Trump teased a possible visit to Istanbul while flying from Saudi Arabia to Qatar on Wednesday, but there was no immediate indication that his travel plans would change.",
      "“He’d like me to be there, and that’s a possibility,” Mr Trump said, referring to Mr Putin.",
      "“I don’t know that he would be there if I’m not there.",
      "We’re going to find out.” Mr Zelensky has been pushing for direct talks with Russia but only if Mr Putin attends.",
      "Mr Putin, who has rebuffed previous such calls, has been coy and has not committed to a meeting.",
      "The Kremlin on Wednesday said Mr Putin’s aide, Vladimir Medinsky, will head the Russian delegation, which also will include deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin, deputy foreign minister Mikhail Galuzin and Igor Kostyukov, chief of the General Staff’s main directorate.",
      "The list did not include Mr Putin himself.",
      "Mr Zelensky also remains keen on Ukraine joining Nato, which Russia has adamantly rejected and Mr Trump appears to have agreed with.",
      "So even with a Ukrainian presence in Antalya, it appeared unlikely there would be any decisions made about Ukraine’s future, or lack thereof, in the military alliance.",
      "Of greater concern to the US is money, with the Trump administration saying it wants to hear how European members of Nato and Canada plan to boost their national defence investments to 5% of gross domestic product.",
      "In 2023, as Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine entered its second year, Nato leaders agreed to spend at least 2% of GDP on national defence budgets.",
      "So far, 22 of the 32 member countries have done so.",
      "The leaders will set a new goal at a summit in The Hague on June 25.",
      "Mr Trump insists that US allies should commit to spending at least 5% to be ready to defend themselves, but that would require investment at an unprecedented scale.",
      "Mr Trump has cast doubt over whether the US would defend allies that spend too little.",
      "The US was projected to have spent 3.38% last year, Nato figures show, the only ally whose spending has dropped over the last decade.",
      "Asked last month whether the US would match the 5% target, Mr Rubio said: “Sure.",
      "We’re heading there now.” It is an open question whether Donald Trump will participate in ceasefire talks on Thursday (Alex Brandon/AP) “Make no mistake, this ministerial is going to be different,” US envoy to Nato Matthew Whitaker said this week, adding: “5% is not just a number, it is a necessity for our security.",
      "The alliance is facing significant threats.” He did not outline those threats.",
      "Nato leaders insisted at their summit last year that “Russia remains the most significant and direct threat to Allies’ security”, but some countries are uneasy about Mr Trump re-engaging with Mr Putin.",
      "Mr Fidan, the Turkish foreign minister who is hosting the meeting, is expected to express Turkey’s commitment to strengthening Nato and call for the inclusion of Nato allies that are not European Union members — such as Turkey — into European security and defence initiatives, according to Turkish officials.",
      "Mr Fidan also would advocate a comprehensive, “360-degree security” approach focusing not only on ending the Russia-Ukraine war but also on stability in the Middle East and regions adjacent to Nato members, the officials said.",
      "Meanwhile, the defence spending plan under consideration appears to be for all allies to aim for 3.5% of GDP on “hard military spending by 2032”, and an extra “1.5% related spending (on) infrastructure, cybersecurity and things like that.",
      "Also achievable by 2032,” according to the Dutch government.",
      "While the two figures add up to 5%, factoring in infrastructure and cybersecurity would change the basis on which Nato traditionally calculates defence spending.",
      "The seven-year time frame is also short by the alliance’s usual standards.",
      "Mr Whitaker, the US Nato ambassador, appeared this week to confirm the plan, saying it “also includes things like mobility, necessary infrastructure, cybersecurity”.",
      "“It is definitely more than just missiles, tanks and howitzers,” he said.",
      "It is difficult to see how many allies might reach even 3.5% of GDP.",
      "The meeting in Turkey may provide more clarity."

      "However, it's believed he'll be looking over his shoulder for the rest of his life as the families of his victims now have an opportunity for revenge.",
      "Denis Gorin, 45, hailing from the town of Aniva in Russia's Sakhalin region, was sentenced to 22 years in a penal colony in 2018.",
      "This sentence was handed down after Gorin stabbed a man to death and then consumed some of his victim's flesh.",
      "In early 2023, while still in the penal colony, Gorin signed up with a private military company (PMC) and was deployed to Ukraine to participate in Russia's invasion of the country.",
      "Gorin served in the ranks of Storm-Z and was injured during a battle.",
      "Following this, President Putin pardoned him, allowing Gorin to return as a free man to his hometown.",
      "This move sparked widespread outrage across Russia and ignited a heated debate about the morality of authorities pardoning criminals for their participation in the war, reports the Mirror US.",
      "By all accounts, Gorin started his life on the right track and was well-regarded by locals who knew him growing up.",
      "He wasn't known to engage in any criminal activities or aggressive behaviour and appeared to be a trusted member of the community.",
      "However, after finishing high school, he got married and had two children, which he found difficult to provide for.",
      "Financial difficulties began to plague the family due to Gorin's lack of further education.",
      "In the early 2000s, Gorin turned to alcohol and ended up living on the streets.",
      "In late 2002, at the age of 23, he committed his first known murder.",
      "The victim was someone he knew, and Gorin was arrested shortly afterwards and charged with murder and desecration of a corpse.",
      "During his trial, Gorin revealed that after killing the victim, he removed and consumed the soft tissues from the body, claiming he did so under threat from his brother Yevgeny.",
      "As reported by the New York Post, Yevgeny, who was an accomplice, allegedly threatened to kill him if he didn't eat part of the victim.",
      "On March 6, 2003, Gorin was handed a sentence of nine years and 11 months in a strict regime colony, serving his time at an undisclosed location in the Irkutsk Oblast.",
      "After seven years, he was released on parole on April 19, 2010, and returned to Aniva, where he continued his life on the streets for the next few years.",
      "During this time, Gorin was jobless, making money through odd jobs and theft, spending most of his time among other homeless people and alcoholics.",
      "It is reported that Denis then acted with the help of his brother Yevgeny, committing several more murders in his hometown.",
      "In June 2011, the Gorin brothers were incensed upon discovering that their nephew had been mistreated by an acquaintance.",
      "They stormed the apartment to confront the man, who was absent.",
      "Instead, they brutally assaulted a young man, unconnected to their nephew's incident, until he lost consciousness.",
      "Seizing the opportunity, Denis slit the victim's throat.",
      "The brothers then transported the body to the Lyutoga River bank, where it was buried in a shallow grave.",
      "The victim's remains stayed concealed until they were unearthed in spring 2012.",
      "The brothers' next act of murder occurred on the night of 14–15 January 2012.",
      "During a visit to a local store, they clashed with an acquaintance, whom Denis proceeded to stab approximately 30 times with a knife.",
      "The man later succumbed to his injuries.",
      "On the same day, the murderer was apprehended by the police and promptly confessed.",
      "On 27 February 2013, he was found guilty of both murders and sentenced to 20 years and 10 months in prison.",
      "His brother Evgeniy didn't live to witness the trial; he died under mysterious circumstances while detained at a temporary detention centre in Aniva in mid-2012.",
      "Following his trial, Gorin was moved to a penal colony.",
      "However, in June 2017, he reached out to the Sakhalin Oblast Prosecutor's Office and confessed to an unsolved murder, leading to his return to Aniva for testimony.",
      "According to Gorin, this additional killing took place on 21 November 2010, with the victim being another acquaintance named Alexander.",
      "This confession brought Gorin's murder count to four, solidifying his status as a serial killer.",
      "Denis, Alexander's brother, had been held at a temporary detention centre from 25 February to 6 March 2003, a period during which Gorin was also present.",
      "While sharing drinks, Gorin recounted a story that amused him about a time when he and Denis were both in the detention centre.",
      "Alexander, who was drunk, had attempted to deliver a parcel to his brother but was arrested for disorderly conduct due to his visible intoxication.",
      "The story seemed to irritate Alexander, leading to a heated argument and subsequent separation.",
      "Later that same night, after attending his ex-wife's birthday party, a drunken Gorin decided to visit Alexander's house to settle their earlier disagreement.",
      "Instead of resolving their issues, they continued to argue, culminating in Gorin grabbing a knife and stabbing Alexander twice in the chest.",
      "After Alexander's death, Gorin gruesomely cut off pieces of the man's biceps, calves, and thighs, which he chillingly proceeded to eat.",
      "He then dragged the lifeless body to the old familiar Lyutoga River, where he undressed it, picked it up, and hauled it into the water.",
      "Gorin pulled the body a significant distance from the shore before discarding it.",
      "He then returned to his ex-wife's birthday party, as if nothing had happened.",
      "Despite leaving for approximately 35–40 minutes, apparently nobody had noticed Gorin's absence during this time.",
      "When quizzed about why he ate parts of his victim's remains, Gorin simply explained that he had developed a taste for human flesh after committing his first murder back in 2002.",
      "In the months following, however, he recanted his testimony and claimed that the police had tortured him into confessing.",
      "Despite his claims, the overwhelming amount of evidence proved that he had indeed committed the murder, and on June 27, 2018, Gorin was handed a 22-year prison sentence.",
      "He managed to avoid receiving life imprisonment due to his initial confession and cooperation with law enforcement, before he was even given time served by the district court.",
      "With these factors taken into account, he was scheduled for release in 2032.",
      "The actual number of victims a cannibal has claimed remains hotly contested, with some neighbours buzzing that he boasted about killing upwards of 13 people.",
      "The man's wartime exploits add further murkiness to the tally.",
      "\"Dmitri,\" a neighbour, chillingly recounted how, upon his 2012 arrest, cops flung open a fridge to discover stacks of human flesh, prepped for consumption.",
      "\"Dmitri\" spilled more beans: the two brothers once tried offing another local in boozy violence, and Denis had hauled him to a hole purportedly crammed with 12 corpses' remnants.",
      "The neighbour reckoned this pit held a clutch of skeletons including what looked like a little girl's.",
      "The bobbies have kept mum, leaving everyone guessing if they dug deeper into these sinister tales.",
      "Hence, Gorin's kill count might be vastly underrated.",

      "By Rod McGuirk, Associated Press The Council of the International Civil Aviation Organisation says Russia was responsible for shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 more than a decade ago, in a ruling that raises the prospect of victims’ families being paid compensation.",
      "The flight, known as MH17, was shot down over Ukraine in 2014 with the loss of 298 lives.",
      "A Dutch-led international investigation concluded in 2016 that the Amsterdam-to-Kuala Lumpur airliner was shot down on July 17 2014, from Ukrainian territory held by separatist rebels using a Buk missile system delivered from Russia.",
      "Moscow denies any involvement in the MH17 tragedy.",

      "Presiding judge Hendrik Steenhuis, other trial judges and lawyers view the reconstructed wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 (Peter Dejong/AP, Pool, File) The council found that Russia had violated the Convention on International Civil Aviation, known as the Chicago Convention, which requires that states “refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight”.",
      "It is the first time that the council, which represents 193 member states, has decided on a dispute between governments.",
      "Dutch foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp said that the council would consider the question of reparations within weeks.",
      "“In that context, the Netherlands and Australia are requesting that the ICAO council order the Russian Federation to enter into negotiations with the Netherlands and Australia, and that the Council facilitate this process,” Mr Veldkamp said in a statement.",
      "“The latter is important in order to ensure that the negotiations are conducted in good faith and according to specific timelines, and that they will yield actual results,” he added.",
      "Australian foreign minister Penny Wong urged the council to move swiftly to “determine remedies”.",
      "“We call on Russia to finally face up to its responsibility for its horrific act of violence and make reparations for its egregious conduct, as required under international law,” Ms Wong said in a statement.",

      "By Michelle L Price, Associated Press US Vice President JD Vance has said Russia was “asking for too much” in its initial peace offer as the United States looks to bring about an end to the war in Ukraine.",
      "The vice president, speaking at a Washington meeting hosted by the Munich Security Conference, did not elaborate on Moscow’s terms, but said he was not pessimistic about the possibility of a peace deal.",
      "That is a more sanguine assessment than President Donald Trump’s recent scepticism that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to end the war that begin in February 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "“I wouldn’t say that the Russians are uninterested in bringing this thing to a resolution,” Mr Vance said.",
      "“What I would say is right now the Russians are asking for a certain set of requirements, a certain set of concessions in order to end the conflict.",
      "We think they’re asking for too much.” Mr Trump, when asked later on Wednesday about the vice president’s comments, told reporters at the White House: “Well, it’s possible that’s right.” He seemed to imply that Mr Vance had details that he did not have because he was preoccupied with other matters.",
      "“We are getting to a point where some decisions are going to have to be made.",
      "I’m not happy about it,” Mr Trump said of the peace effort.",
      "Mr Vance did not repeat any of the criticisms of Volodymyr Zelensky that he had aired during an Oval Office row in February with the Ukrainian leader, and he made a point of saying the US appreciated Ukraine’s willingness to have a 30-day ceasefire.",
      "But the Republican vice president, citing Russia’s unwillingness on that point, said the US would like to move past that and have the Russian and Ukrainian leaders sit down directly to negotiate a long-term settlement that would end the fighting.",
      "“What the Russians have said is, ‘A 30-day ceasefire is not in our strategic interests’.",
      "So we’ve tried to move beyond the obsession with the 30-day ceasefire and more on the, what would a long-term settlement look like,” Mr Vance said.",
      "Mr Vance’s speech at the conference event followed his appearance at the organisation’s February summit in Germany, where he ruffled feathers for his comments that free speech is “in retreat” across Europe.",
      "Mr Vance addressed that on Wednesday and said his comments applied to the US under Democratic president Joe Biden’s administration, just as they did to Europe.",
      "“It’s not ‘Europe bad, America good’.",
      "It’s that I think that both Europe and the United States, we got a little bit off track, and I encourage us all to get back on track together,” he said.",
      "On the Middle East, Mr Vance did not shed light on the timing of planned talks between the US and Iran over Iran’s nuclear programme.",
      "He said the Trump administration felt the inspection and enforcement provisions in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal negotiated under Democratic president Barack Obama were “incredibly weak” and “allowed Iran to sort of stay on this glide path toward a nuclear weapon if they flip the switch and press go”.",
      "“We think that there is a deal here that would reintegrate Iran into the global economy, that would be really good for the Iranian people, but would result in the complete cessation of any chance that they can get a nuclear weapon.",
      "And that’s what we’re negotiating toward,” Mr Vance said."

      "By Kim Tong-Hyung, Associated Press North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has called for his munitions industry to boost the production of artillery shells, state media said on Wednesday.",
      "North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Mr Kim, during recent visits to unspecified munitions and machinery factories, praised modernisation efforts that the agency claimed enabled the facilities to double their annual shell production capacity.",
      "Mr Kim urged workers to further accelerate artillery shell production, calling it crucial to “strengthening the fighting efficiency” of his armed forces, and also called for the development of more advanced machinery to boost munitions output.",
      "The call comes as the country continues to supply arms and troops to support Russia’s war on Ukraine.",
      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visits a munitions factory (Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service/AP) KCNA did not mention any comments from Mr Kim regarding his support for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Recent South Korean intelligence assessments suggest North Korea has sent about 15,000 soldiers to Russia, and that nearly 5,000 of them have been killed or injured while fighting against Ukrainian forces.",
      "Washington and Seoul have also accused North Korea of supplying Russia with various types of military equipment, including artillery systems and shells and ballistic missiles.",
      "After denying its war involvement for months, North Korea last month confirmed for the first time that it had sent combat troops to help Russia in recapturing parts of the Kursk region, which had fallen to a surprise Ukrainian incursion last year.",
      "Moscow also acknowledged the North Korean involvement, with Mr Putin issuing a statement thanking the North for sending troops to support his forces and promising not to forget their sacrifices.",
      "Analysts say North Korea’s official acknowledgement of its military support for Russia is likely aimed at cementing a deeper, long-term partnership with Moscow and securing greater compensation, potentially including advanced military technology that could enhance the threat posed by Mr Kim’s nuclear-armed forces.",
      "By formalising its role as a participant in the war, North Korea may also be positioning itself to seek compensation in future negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine, according to a recent report by the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank affiliated with South Korea’s intelligence agency.",
      "In a closed-door briefing to lawmakers last month, South Korea’s National Intelligence Service also said it believes North Korea has sent about 15,000 workers to Russia under bilateral industrial cooperation programmes.",
      "While the value of North Korean artillery and missiles supplied to Russia likely amounts to billions of dollars, there are no immediate signs that Russia has provided direct cash payments in return, the agency said.",
      "Instead, Russia has likely compensated North Korea with air defence missiles, electronic warfare equipment, drones and technology for spy satellite launches, according to the assessment."

      "BRITAIN is bracing for a devastating Russian offensive that could involve nuclear strikes and crippling cyber attacks amid fears the country is not for ready for war.",
      "Government officials are racing to update decades-old contingency plans to protect the country and prepare for any potential combat.",
      "The classified \"home defence plan\" would lay out how Downing Street will respond if Vladimir Putin declares war on the UK, including moving the Royal Family into bunkers.",
      "Ministers worry Britain could be outfought by Russia on the battlefield, but also poorly defended at home as things stand.",
      "Experts have warned that the country's national infrastructure is vulnerable ahead of the release of Labour's Strategic Defence Review - an examination of the Armed Forces.",
      "As military warfare has evolved in the past two decades, fears are that Putin could launch a combination of attacks, including conventional ballistic missile strikes, sabotage and the latest tactic in the Russian playbook - cyber warfare.",
      "But Britain - which is just beginning to review and revise its security and contingency plans for the first time in more than 20 years - is feared to not be fully prepared to go to war against the Russians.",
      "Former Nato commander Colonel Hamish De Bretton-Gordon told The Sun: \"Britain is very much in the sights of Putin's derision, and we are the ones likely to be attacked first.",
      "\"Britain really has got to dust off its contingency plans.",
      "Over 20 years of neglect, and we understand that's exactly what this report is about at the moment.\"",
      "Retired military officer Colonel Richard Kemp, who was working in the Cabinet Office when the contingency plans were last updated, told The Sun: \"Contingency plans like this should be updated frequently.",
      "Twenty years is far too long, especially given the radically changed threat picture.",
      "\"Putin has said Britain is in his crosshairs since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",
      "\"Even before then, he proved he was willing to attack this country, including with a nerve agent attack in Salisbury in 2018.",
      "We should take him seriously.\"",
      "The classified plan by the Cabinet Office's Resilience Directorate - which was last updated in 2005 - would set out war strategies in the event of a catastrophic attack by the Russians, which could well involve tactical and strategic nuclear weapons.",
      "The plan is based on the War Book, a Cold War dossier of instructions for government response to nuclear attacks.",
      "Under such plans, Britain could be divided into 12 zones, each governed by Cabinet ministers, and food rationed.",
      "The plans will include scenarios like widespread sabotage and crippling cyber warfare, which were seen as a limited threat back when the document was last updated.",
      "It will also direct the PM on how to run a wartime government, as well as strategies for travel networks, courts and the postal system, reports the Daily Telegraph.",
      "Although the highly-classified document is expected to never be revealed in the public domain, military experts suggest what could be changed to prepare us for a potential war against the Russians.",
      "Colonel Bretton-Gordon said that cyber attacks will be given a major chunk of attention in the latest round of updates.",
      "He believes the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) would be given additional funding to improve the existing measures against cyber attackers.",
      "There is particular concern for the country's five active nuclear power stations, which if damaged by strikes, could release radioactive material across the country, resulting in long-term impact.",
      "In the event of an all-out war against Putin, members of the Royal family and key government officials will be sent to secret hideout bunkers to protect them.",
      "Food circulation and modern logistics systems will be made more robust to ensure essential items can reach people whenever there is a need.",
      "And the public will be made more aware of their wartime duties.",
      "Bretton-Gordon added: \"Plans will be to make sure our critical infrastructure is as secure as it can be.",
      "\"There will be contingency plans.",
      "If one nuclear power station goes down, then othe ther power infrastructure can take up the slack.",
      "\"During the Cold War, the people probably had a lot of training and expertise to deal with contaminated nuclear casualties, but the situation has probably changed now.",
      "\"These are the sort of things that just need to be reviewed, so that in the event this happens, it's not a complete shock.\"",
      "\"We are up against an autocratic tyrant who has absolutely no concern for collateral damage or civilian casualties.",
      "\"I'm sure Putin wouldn't think twice about firing a missile, nuclear or conventional, at London cities and the UK's critical national infrastructure.\"",
      "Russia, on many occasions, has threatened to wipe out UK off the world map.",
      "And with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer leading the European defence plan alongside the French to support Ukraine, Putin and his deputies in the Kremlin could see the UK as a possible target.",
      "Bretton-Gordon said: \"What has changed recently is the threats coming out of Moscow that actually Britain, which is leading the coalition of the willing with the French.",
      "\"There are a number of scenarios that could lead us into conflict with the Russians, and the prospect of that then leads to the prospect of nuclear attack.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Colonel Kemp warned that Russia could attack Britain in several ways that could wreak havoc on the nation - and our armed forces are simply not prepared enough to fight Putin's troops.",
      "He added: \"We could be the target of large-scale ballistic missile, cruise missile, drone, cyber, chemical and even nuclear strikes as well as sabotage.",
      "\"I would hope that what has recently been happening in Ukraine and the Middle East has galvanised our leaders so that we are prepared.",
      "But we have a huge amount of ground to make up.",
      "\"The best way to avoid such things happening to us is deterring an attack.",
      "That means we need to substantially increase our own offensive as well as defensive capabilities.\"",
      "The Cabinet Office ran a risk assessment in January in which it modelled a scenario in which a hostile foreign state launched various types of attack on the UK's infrastructure.",
      "It found that any such successful strike could be devastating.",
      "A senior RAF official said last month if Russia had attacked the UK in the same way as it had Ukraine more than three years ago - within hours missiles would have broken through defences and destroyed key targets.",
      "Military experts agree that Britain's air defence systems are not adequate to thwart a large-scale missile attack.",
      "Colonel Kemp said: \"One of our major weaknesses is air defence, both for our forces and homeland defence.",
      "\"Putin has significant long-range missile and attack drone capability, which could be used against us.",
      "\"The other day, a Houthi ballistic missile from Yemen penetrated Israel’s air defences and struck their international airport.",
      "\"Israel has the most comprehensive and advanced air and missile defence systems in the world.",
      "\"That shows how vulnerable any country can be to attack, and we have nothing even approaching Israel’s capabilities.\"",
      "Bretton-Gordon added: \"I expect, as part of the Strategic Defence Review, a lot of focus will be on air defence.",
      "\"But it's not just missiles and fighter jets, the Ukraine war shows how effective drone warfare could be.\"",
      "Colonel Kemp previously told The Sun that there is an \"extremely wide gap\" in the capabilities of the current forces and that he government certainly needs to have plans for conscription \"if the situation deteriorates\".",
      "Speaking to The Sun, he said: \"The capability gap is extremely wide.",
      "The PM talks about deploying British forces to Ukraine, but the reality is we couldn’t field a significant military force.",
      "\"The British armed forces need to be dramatically expanded both in manpower and fighting equipment such as ships, tanks and planes.",
      "\"We could no longer deploy troops on the scale of the Falklands War, Afghanistan or Iraq.",
      "\"We don’t have adequate numbers of infantrymen, armoured vehicles, artillery, engineers, air defences or munitions to keep them fighting.",
      "\"I’m sure we’re up to strength in diversity officers but they don’t win wars.\"",
      "Lt Col Stuart Crawford, author of Defence Review, said the armed forces have “failed to recruit enough people for the last 10 years”, so we must first sort out the regulars.",
      "He said: “The forces are seen as declining organizations - which they are - and have been for at least the last 25 years, because of a lack of resources and funding.” At the moment, there’s “nowhere to train these people”, “nothing to equip these people with”, and “not enough people to instruct them.”"

      "The desperate Russian despot has been offering teenagers and vulnerable civilians cash in exchange for their lives, according to Ukrainian security services.",
      "Back in March, a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old were recruited by Putin's henchmen and given orders to construct and carry a bag of explosives through a Ukrainian city, reports New Lines Magazine.",
      "The teens were walking through the city of Ivano-Frankivsk when the improvised explosives they were carrying suddenly exploded.",
