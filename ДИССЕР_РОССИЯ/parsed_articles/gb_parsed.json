      "Ministers meeting in Canada said if efforts to achieve a ceasefire failed they would explore more options but language weaker than before Donald Trump’s reelection.",
      "What we know on day 1,185 G7 finance chiefs condemned what they called Russia’s “continued brutal war” against Ukraine and said that if efforts to achieve a ceasefire failed, they would explore all possible options, including “further ramping up sanctions.” The description of the Ukraine war was watered down from the prior G7 statement issued in October, before Donald Trump’s re-election, calling it an “illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine.” Trump has diminished US support for Ukraine and has made statements suggesting that Kyiv was to blame for the conflict as he tries to coax Russia into peace talks.",
      "Ukraine should abandon any notion of restoring its borders established with the 1991 collapse of Soviet rule or even those dating from the 2022 full-scale Russian invasion, the country’s former military commander was quoted as saying on Thursday.",

      "“My personal opinion is that the enemy still has resources, forces and means to launch strikes on our territory and attempt specific offensive operations.” Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned on Thursday that Russia threatened security in Europe as he visited Lithuania to mark the official formation of Germany’s first permanent overseas military unit since the second world war, aimed at bolstering Nato’s eastern flank.",
      "The decision to build up a 5,000-strong armoured brigade in Lithuania over the coming years came in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",
      "“There is a threat to us all from Russia,” Merz told reporters in Vilnius.",
      "Russia has appointed a key commander of the gruelling siege of Mariupol, Gen Andrey Mordvichev, as head of the ground forces, the official newspaper of the Russian army reported on Thursday.",
      "Defence minister Andrey Belousov described the 49-year-old general as “an experienced combat officer who fully demonstrated his talent as a military commander during the special military operation,” using Moscow’s term for its Ukraine offensive, according to the Red Star newspaper.",
      "Russia said it had shot down 159 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions, including about 20 headed towards Moscow, between 8 am and 8 pm on Thursday.",

      "Mayor of Bilopillya, where nine people were killed in strike on bus, says Russia has shown it does not care about talks Even before the Russian strike on a shuttle bus travelling from his frontline town at the weekend, the mayor of Bilopillya, Yuri Zarko, was very sceptical that Vladimir Putin’s agreement to direct Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul would lead to peace.",
      "The strike, which killed nine people including five over 60, only confirmed his conviction that talks to end the war were going nowhere and Ukraine had a challenging time ahead.",
      "“I was born an optimist,” Zarko said in a cafe in the neighbouring regional capital of Sumy, which he had reached taking a lift in one of his town’s ambulances along a dangerous road that is often shelled by the Russians.",
      "“But there’s a funny story that I like about how an optimist and pessimist meet.",
      "The pessimist says: life is getting worse!",
      "The optimist replies: oh, but it will be much worse later.",
      "That describes where we are.” Ukrainian and Russian delegations met face-to-face in Istanbul last week for the first time since 2022, but without Russia agreeing to a US-proposed 30-day ceasefire already accepted by Kyiv.",
      "A subsequent two-hour phone call on Monday between Putin and Donald Trump also ended without Russian agreement to a ceasefire.",
      "The war goes on.",
      "“It’s very difficult situation in my town.",
      "The centre of Bilopillya is 10km from the Russian border and the outskirts are 5-6km away,” Zarko said.",
      "“Every day and every night there is shelling, usually glide bombs.",
      "Ten days ago we had a day where there were 120 strikes throughout the area of our community.",
      "The Russians are very active now.” Between 85 and 90% of those living in his town had now evacuated, he said, with banks, supermarkets and other key services closed for those who remain.",
      "He showed a picture on his phone of a recent strike by a 1.5-tonne bomb that left a crater 5 metres deep and 10 across, dwarfing those standing at its rim.",
      "He knows what has happened to towns similar to his in other parts of Ukraine – to Bakhmut, Chasiv Yar, Pokrovsk and Avdiivka, where Russian artillery and bombs turned or are turning them to rubble – and hopes the same fate can be avoided for his own town of 16,000.",
      "“I need Bilopillya to survive,” he said.",
      "But Zarko is aware that what happens next is out of his hands.",
      "“There are no peace negotiations,” he said.",
      "“We can see how the Russian side is trying to prolong the talks just to buy time.",
      "What happened with the shuttle bus was proof of that.",
      "“It was timed after the peace talks in Istanbul had broken up.",
      "It was a gesture to the civilised world, to EU leaders.",
      "It was meant to punch them on the nose, a message from the Russians to say: we don’t care about peace negotiations.” On Zarko’s mind, and of those in the wider Sumy region, are comments made this week by Putin on a visit to the neighbouring Kursk region of Russia – where Ukraine last year launched a major incursion – that turning Sumy into a “sanitised grey zone” was a more practical solution than using Russian forces to take it, as one local municipal leader suggested.",
      "On Thursday that threat became suddenly concrete as Putin said he had ordered his military “to create a security buffer zone” along the border and that operation was already in progress.",
      "At first glance, the situation in Sumy on a warm spring day belies the threat, with residents walking on tree-lined boulevards and sitting in cafes.",
      "But the reality of life here is constant air alarms from drones, loitering munitions and KAB glide bombs.",
      "The city was partly occupied by Russian forces at the beginning of the war in 2022.",
      "“The first two months of the war were very tough days but then the situation stabilised for a while,” said Oksana Solodovnyk, a regional correspondent for the 1+1 channel.",
      "The situation had got much worse again since Ukraine’s incursion into Kursk last year, she said.",
      "“Our day starts at midnight because of drones and glide bombs.",
      "They all fly over my house, not always very high.",
      "My daughter is nine and I worry about her.",
      "She can only go into her school one day a week because they are teaching in the basement.",
      "“Recently it feels like the Russians have changed tactic.",
      "Because drones coming in low can be shot down, they are using Lancets like ballistic missile.",
      "They fire them up high and then they dive down.",
      "Two days ago they attacked a big plant in Sumy with seven strikes.",
      "The lack of sleep makes people exhausted and anxious.” Solodovnyk said she and her friends hoped for something out of peace talks but were under no illusions that even if there was a ceasefire everything would stop and peace would come immediately.",
      "She said Trump was helping the side that was stronger and had more money, so Ukraine would have to rely on its military.",
      "“My personal feeling is that if we are going to have peace talks it should be between the two leaders,” she said.",
      "“And while I dream about a return to Ukraine’s 1991 border including Crimea, I realise it’s unreal.",
      "I want it but I know it is a fantastic dream and that feeling is splitting me in half because a lot of friends have died fighting for Ukraine.",
      "“But I also know that if we freeze the conflict for a while along the frontlines, Russia will never stop.” “Everyone wants peace,” said Oleksandr Miroshnychenko, an agricultural company executive.",
      "“We are living under stress every day and every night because of the explosions.",
      "“But I’m not sure anyone will help us.",
      "Europe is helping us enough to avoid Putin annexing parts of their territory.",
      "We hope America will help, but the last Trump statement saying we should just talk to Putin suggests that the situation will get worse.",
      "“If I am realistic then maybe the war will end next year.",

      "Thursday 22 May 2025 15:31, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Security and defence analyst Michael Clarke has just finished answering your Ukraine war questions - thanks to everyone who followed along and took part.",
      "Scroll down through this live page to catch up, or check out the key points.",
      "You can also watch it back at the top of the page.",
      "\"There is no succession plan because people like Putin never have one, because the plan may then become a threat to their own future,\" says Michael Clarke.",
      "\"A successor will be almost certainly in the Putin mould because Putin is surrounded now by sycophants - not unlike in the White House - who have all absorbed what he's created over the last 25 years.\"",
      "Their attitude to the war will be similar, Clarke says.",
      "\"Over the last 25 years, the Russians have given up on the idea of peaceful coexistence.",
      "\"They've come to the idea of security and peace through fear.\"",
      "A leader emerging with a different view is a long way off, he adds.",
      "\"I'd say if Putin were to disappear next month, there'd be some period of chaos and it'd be the next [leader] but one, or maybe the next but two... who we might be able to get back on terms with.\"",
      "Clarke says: \"At the moment, peaceful coexistence is a foolish concept in the Kremlin - and it's a bit of a foolish concept in Beijing.\"",
      "\"This is a good question,\" Clarke says.",
      "He says Russia's shadow fleet can be anything from 400 to 1,400 ships, with ships swapping from \"legitimate to shadow fleet\" on a whim.",
      "Clarke adds that the \"time may have come\" for the West to be \"more muscular\" when dealing with shadow fleet vessels.",
      "\"My own view is to board them, bring them into a NATO port, send the crew home, and then we can argue for the next five to ten years legally as the ship rusts and rust away without any maintenance.\"",
      "He says the problem so far has been getting enough evidence to hand over to the Maritime Arbitration Service or the courts.",
      "\"The thing that would make the most difference to Russia's perceptions would be much more military aid to Ukraine, so that the Russians start to lose some of this territory that they've taken so laboriously in the last 18 months,\" says Michael Clarke.",
      "The situation on the battlefield could be changed if the Americans were prepared to put another $60bn into it, as they did in March last year, he says.",
      "\"Ukraine has the capacity to push Russian forces back, possibly quite a long way.",
      "\"If the Russians started to lose territory, then they'd be much, much keener on the ceasefire.\"",
      "Watch below: Putin visiting Russian region of Kurks this week - after Ukrainian troops pushed out Moscow can cope with sanctions, having worked out ways to circumvent them, says Clarke.",
      "\"The only thing that would make Putin reassess is losing territory on the battlefield in some relatively serious way.\"",
      "He adds: \"The Biden administration, famously, they gave Ukraine enough to stop losing, but not enough to win.\"",
      "European armaments are too underdeveloped to help Ukraine this year, but if they are still fighting in 2026, \"then things would look a bit different next year\".",
      "The current situation is \"not quite a stalemate\" but is \"moving forward in Russia's favour but very, very slowly,\" says Sky News' security and defence analyst Michael Clarke.",
      "\"They take some territory, they take some of the big cities, but then they don't get very far afterwards.\"",
      "He says in 15 months the Russian army has \"slogged away\" to get 30 miles westward of the city of Avdiivka, which Moscow took in February last year.",
      "Russian forces \"should be 30 miles away within 48 hours if they've made a strategic breakthrough\" but instead have only \"covered 30 miles in 15 months,\" he adds.",
      "\"So are the Russians likely to make a strategic breakthrough?",
      "I don't see it.",
      "Looking at the reinforcements they've brought on stream, their army's getting less and less expert, just bigger.\"",
      "He says the Russian army is \"like a sponge: if you hit it, it just gets absorbed, but equally the sponge doesn't have that much of a punch of its own\".",
      "Elon Musk rushed thousands of Starlink terminals to Ukraine to replace communications services destroyed by Russia after its February 2022 invasion.",
      "There have been concerns that Musk could turn off the service, though the Tesla and SpaceX owner said in March he would keep it running \"no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy\".",
      "Clarke says Musk \"certainly would\" turn off Starlink if US President Donald Trump asked him to do so.",
      "\"The thing about Starlink is it is so technically superb - you've got to give Elon Musk credit,\" he says.",
      "\"Starlink is critical to Ukraine's war effort.",
      "It's not absolutely vital, but it is... they would miss it.",
      "And Europeans couldn't replace it quickly if Musk turned it off.\"",
      "In terms of Europe paying for the service, Clarke points out that it already is.",
      "\"Poland pays $50m a year for all the Starlink terminals.",
      "There's 40,000 terminals, give or take, in Ukraine, and they're all paid for.",
      "The subscription is paid for by the Polish government.\"",
      "Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine is often called the first major drone war.",
      "As the conflict has dragged on, drones without warheads have been used as decoys.",
      "Their main task is to disrupt detection and interception systems targeting air threats, forcing the enemy to waste expensive missiles on fake targets.",
      "Clarke says: \"If they [Russia] send enough drones in waves, which they do, then a proportion can be just empty.",
      "\"You're faced with 70 incoming drones in the first wave and you've got to decide, are you going to use 70 missiles to bring them all down and then find that in the next wave, you haven't got 70 missiles available?\"",
      "By increasing the number of drones with real warheads in each wave, the Russians then face weaker and weaker defences with stronger and stronger attacks.",
      "He adds Russia has created a new type of Shahed drone that can vary its speed using AI, making it harder to track.",
      "\"The defender then needs AI to work out more carefully what's happening.\"",
      "Drones are cheap, simple, can be launched from anywhere, and can overwhelm the defence.",
      "Ukraine is currently bringing down 60% of each attack.",
      "At the point this reaches 30%, and Russia launches 200-300 drones three times a week, that \"would change the situation in the air war\".",
      "The price of crude oil needs to drop to $50 or below per barrel in order to have an effect on Russia, Sky News' security and defence analyst Michael Clarke says.",
      "\"Given their oil prices are drifting down, the Russians can live with $60,\" he says.",
      "He says that was thought to be a break-even price, where Moscow would not get so much income that they could fund the war.",
      "\"Now, if the price goes down to $50, even $55 by some analysis, then the Russians are in trouble,\" he adds.",
      "\"Then they're starting to actually break into their reserves to fund their war.",
      "They're not being able to fund it from energy income.\"",
      "For reference, the current price of crude oil is around $63 per barrel.",
      "Asked what could be done to force the price down below $50 per barrel, he says one key lesson from the war is that you cannot force the market to do something.",
      "\"You can't really manipulate the market in political ways, as we tried.",
      "So I don't think anything will force the oil prices down, except market conditions, because it's such a big industry,\" he explains.",
      "\"I don't think the Western nations can actually engineer it, because the market is just too powerful, but the market looks as if it is drifting downwards.\"",
      "The Home Guard was an unpaid, armed citizen militia formed of men too old or young to serve in the military in the 1940s.",
      "Their task was to defend Britain against the Nazis in case of a land invasion.",
      "The new government plans to revive the idea, with the group intended to protect Britain's key infrastructure from foreign threats and terror attacks.",
      "Michael Clarke says the government knows that any announcement on this will be \"full of Dad's Army\" jokes.",
      "\"There'll be no shortage of Mr Mainwaring,\" he jokes, referring to Arthur Lowe's beloved character from the BBC sitcom.",
      "He says the Home Guard would relieve the army and the police from \"all sorts of things\" and would come in especially useful \"if we find ourselves in a militarised crisis with the Russians in the next ten years\".",
      "\"It wouldn't be a joke,\" he adds.",
      "\"It would be really important stuff.",
      "They would be properly trained and properly equipped and paid.\"",
      "Clarke says the Home Guard could be brought into existence \"in the next three to four years\".",
      "Sky News' security and defence analyst Professor Michael Clarke says this is the fourth time he has heard the idea pitched.",
      "Its failure in the 1960s was behind the anti-ballistic missile treaty because they knew a dome didn't work.",
      "The idea was then resurrected under Reagan and Bush in the 1980s and 2000s without success, he adds.",
      "\"Donald Trump is talking about the Golden Dome as if it's a version of Israel's Iron Dome.",
      "\"Israel's land area is 22,000 square kilometres.",
      "Britain's land area is something like 240,000 - so it's ten times bigger - and America's land area is almost 10 million.",
      "\"America is 400 times bigger than Israel, and the Israeli Iron Dome system is the best in the world, and it is not 100% [effective].",
      "\"The requirement is absolutely huge,\" he says, adding it would cost at least a trillion dollars.",
      "A huge number of land-based interceptors are needed, and they have to be fired at missiles when they are launched, because otherwise the projectiles become too fast.",
      "\"The thing that might make it different... is supposing you could have the defences in space,\" says Clarke.",
      "\"That's heroic engineering.",
      "Can you take what you know exists on Earth and scale it up tenfold, put it in space, maintain it, put the whole system together, and know that the first time you use that system in anger, the first time you've ever been able to test the whole thing together, it will work to 98% effectiveness?",
      "\"Can't be done.\"",
      "Could it work in US or UK?",
      "Clarke says it is \"much, much cheaper\" to put things in space than it was when this idea was previously pitched, but \"the idea of defending a big country is still economically impossible\".",
      "\"You've still got the basic problems.",
      "It will still be cheaper to overwhelm the system than to actually keep the system up.\"",
      "Missile defences are best at defending small areas - a \"special dome\" is \"not technically feasible\".",
      "The UK could do with more missile defences for its ports and major systems, but just as an element of a deterrent, says Clarke.",
      "\"We don't have any real reliable defence at all against incoming missiles, apart from what the Navy has got in the Sea Viper system.\""

      "Johnathan Buma, who was arrested in March and is out on bail, claims in new interview that efforts to target Musk were ‘intense’ A former FBI counterintelligence agent turned whistleblower has claimed he tried to gain access to Elon Musk in 2022 to warn the billionaire that he was the target of a covert Russian campaign seeking to infiltrate his inner circle, possibly to gain access to sensitive information.",
      "Johnathan Buma, who was arrested by the FBI earlier this year on a misdemeanor charge of disclosing confidential information, said in an interview that he tried – but ultimately failed – to gain access to Musk to personally brief and “inoculate” him against “outreach from the Kremlin”.",
      "Buma, who is on bail and living in Arizona after his 17 March arrest at New York’s Kennedy airport, spoke to both ZDF, the German broadcaster, and the Guardian.",
      "He has also recently filed paperwork to run as a Democratic candidate for a congressional House seat in Arizona.",
      "The 48-year-old did not provide specific details about why he believed Musk was being targeted by Russian operatives, but said it involved individuals he believed were being “placed” in Musk’s inner circle at the time and were gaining influence with him.",
      "“Those efforts were intense and they were ongoing,” he said.",
      "“I can’t go into too much more detail.” Musk, the world’s richest man, was not under investigation and was not suspected of wrongdoing, Buma said.",
      "Reporting by the Wall Street Journal indicates that Buma was not the only person who was concerned about individuals who were gaining access to Musk at that time.",
      "A July 2022 article reported that Jared Birchall, who serves as Musk’s wealth manager, had “cornered” his boss to discuss his concerns about a then new adviser to the Tesla CEO named Igor Kurganov, a Russian-born ex-professional gambler.",
      "Birchall reportedly saw Kurganov as a “newcomer who suddenly had immense influence on what to do with Musk’s money”.",
      "The Journal described how Kurganov had spent time sleeping in Musk’s home during the pandemic, and that Musk reportedly told Birchall he was considering leaving Kurganov in charge of his charitable giving.",
      "Musk’s personal fortune was worth about $230bn at the time.",
      "The Journal said it was basing its reporting on more than a dozen people close to Musk, Birchall and Kurganov.",
      "The newspaper also reported at the time that Birchall had learned that an FBI agent had been making preliminary inquiries into Kurganov as part of his job “to watch for foreign interference in US companies”, citing people familiar with the matter.",
      "Kurganov had not been accused of wrongdoing, the Journal reported, and he did not provide a comment to the newspaper at the time.",
      "The Guardian is not aware of Kurganov being named as a foreign agent, and he has no known connections to Russia, other than having been born there.",
      "Efforts to reach him directly did not elicit a response.",
      "The Guardian also reached out to Kurganov’s wife, Liv Boeree, a professional poker player.",
      "She said in an emailed statement: “My husband’s only connection to Russia is that he was pushed out of his Mum’s vagina on its soil.” In his interview with the Guardian, Buma said he did not have direct dealings with Musk.",
      "He said he tried to convey his concerns to another agent, who was described as an FBI liaison to SpaceX, but claimed the other agent was not responsive.",
      "Birchall, the Wall Street Journal reported, asked Musk to remove Kurganov from his post at Musk’s private foundation in May 2022, which Musk then agreed to do.",
      "The FBI’s national press office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Guardian also reached out to the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, which declined to comment.",
      "Musk did not respond to an emailed request for comment.",
      "The Guardian attempted to call and send messages to Birchall via WhatsApp but he did not respond.",
      "Buma’s new claims follow earlier reporting by Business Insider and the Atlantic about Buma’s relationship with another prominent billionaire, Peter Thiel, who reportedly became a source for the FBI in 2021.",
      "Buma, it has previously been reported, was Thiel’s handler.",
      "It is not clear whether Thiel has maintained a source relationship with the FBI.",
      "Thiel and Musk have a long history together.",
      "The two both spent their early years in South Africa.",
      "Thiel founded PayPal, the online payment company where Musk also served as CEO before he was reportedly ousted by Thiel and his allies.",
      "The two are believed to be on good terms, with Thiel crediting Musk’s support for Trump with helping other Silicon Valley leaders support the US president in the run-up to last year’s presidential election.",
      "In his interview with the Guardian, Buma said Thiel had been “receptive to collaboration [with the FBI] and threat briefings”.",
      "“The purpose of the briefings was to educate [Thiel] about what to look out for, what a targeting looks like, what it’s like to be bumped by a foreign intelligence agent, and then what to do when that’s done,” Buma said.",
      "“He essentially confirmed and provided helpful information to help us identify the nodes through which these outreaches have occurred.” Thiel did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Buma has been a controversial figure inside the FBI since he filed his first internal complaint in the bureau in January 2022.",
      "An FBI affidavit, filed on 18 March in the US district court in California in connection to his arrest, describes him as working in various capacities over his 15-year career at the bureau, where from 2013 to 2022 he focused on counterintelligence and counterproliferation matters.",
      "Until December 2022, the FBI has said, his responsibilities included managing “confidential human sources”.",
      "Buma has described himself as specializing for a decade in public corruption and Russian foreign counterintelligence operations, a role that he said led the FBI to train him to speak and read Russian.",
      "In January 2019, a tip from one of Buma’s sources led to the FBI’s first inquiry into possible tax evasion by Joe Biden’s son Hunter, who was a director at the Ukrainian company Burisma.",
      "Hunter Biden pleaded guilty in 2024 to federal tax evasion charges connected to his foreign business deals.",
      "He was later pardoned by his father, the then president Joe Biden, who in a statement said he believed his son had been “selectively and unfairly prosecuted”.",
      "Buma was also involved in an FBI investigation into possibly illegal lobbying and campaign violations involving Rudy Giuliani, the former prosecutor, mayor of New York and personal attorney to Donald Trump.",
      "Giuliani’s home and office were raided in 2021 in connection to FBI suspicions around his dealings with Ukrainian figures, but all of the investigations were ultimately dropped and Giuliani was never charged with any crime as a result of the inquiry.",
      "Buma began seeking whistleblower protection, both inside the FBI and later in Congress, beginning in 2022, when he began to report what he called “highly suspicious suppression of investigations and intelligence gathering” in matters related to the Russian intelligence service.",
      "At the heart of his allegations, which were submitted to the Senate judiciary committee in a 22-page statement, was Buma’s contention that investigations into Giuliani had been quashed and that he had faced internal FBI retaliation, which he said led to the suppression of his intelligence reporting.",
      "It also led, Buma said, to his diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder on 25 October 2023.",
      "At that time, he began to take unpaid leave from the FBI.",
      "Weeks later, on 13 November 2023, federal law enforcement officials raided Buma’s home, according to the FBI affidavit filed in March 2025.",
      "The affidavit claimed that agents found “numerous” FBI documents, including a compilation of emails, in that search.",
      "But Buma was not arrested at that time.",
      "He remained on unpaid leave from the FBI until he submitted a resignation letter on 16 March 2025.",
      "The FBI affidavit also alleged that Buma began emailing chapters of a book draft to associates between October and December 2023, including information that the FBI said was subject to restrictions.",
      "The FBI has alleged that Buma sent messages to individuals at that time that discussed his involvement in press reports about confidential human sources.",
      "Buma has denied wrongdoing.",
      "Even as the FBI officer was facing scrutiny, so was Elon Musk.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported on 25 October 2024 that Musk, who had emerged as an important supporter of Donald Trump’s re-election campaign, had been “in regular contact” with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, since late 2022.",
      "The report cited several current and former US, European and Russian officials and said the conversations touched on personal topics, business and geopolitical tensions.",
      "The Journal report also noted that the contacts raised potential national security concerns, given Musk’s security clearance connected to SpaceX, which has billions of dollars in contracts with the Pentagon, and Musk’s access to classified information.",
      "Musk did not respond to the Journal’s request for comment at the time but posted a comment on X following the story’s publication, including one tweet that said: “Welp, the Swamp’s ‘Trump is Hitler’ didn’t work.",
      "Might as well give ‘Elon is a Russian agent’ a whirl.” Musk has had a high-profile role at the White House since Trump’s November 2024 election victory as the unofficial head of the so-called “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, which has overseen the firing of thousands of federal workers and an attempted dismantling of federal agencies.",
      "Among a myriad of controversies over Doge’s actions was an official whistleblower complaint by a member of the IT department at the National Labor Relations Board, whose disclosure was detailed in a 15 April 2025 report by NPR.",
      "The whistleblower, Daniel Berulis, grew alarmed when technical staff members noticed a spike in sensitive data leaving the NLRB after Doge engineers were granted access to the data, followed by what was described as “suspicious log-in attempts” from an IP address in Russia.",
      "NPR said Berulis’s account was corroborated by internal documentation that was reviewed by 11 technical experts across other government agencies and the private sector.",
      "The report added that Doge’s access to data was a “widespread concern”.",
      "The NLRB has denied that the agency granted Doge access and said it had determined that no breach of agency systems occurred.",
      "Buma was arrested on 17 March 2025, just weeks after Trump’s new director of the FBI, Kash Patel, had been confirmed in his role.",
      "Buma said he was at Kennedy airport awaiting a flight to the UK, where he planned to have a meeting with the HarperCollins publisher Arabella Pike, when he was suddenly surrounded by agents.",
      "He was released on bail the next day.",
      "The bail included a restriction that he refrain from excessive use of alcohol.",
      "This restriction appears to arise from an October 2023 text message reviewed by the FBI.",
      "Buma denies drinking excessively.",
      "His meeting with Pike was canceled by the publisher after his arrest, according to a screenshot of a text message seen by the Guardian.",
      "Pike did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Buma was arraigned in Los Angeles weeks after his arrest, on 1 May, and charged with a single misdemeanor.",
      "US prosecutors have claimed Buma “knowingly published, divulged, disclosed, and made known” the identity and personal identifying information of an individual who was a confidential FBI source.",
      "Buma told the Guardian he believed this was related to the news report that publicly identified Thiel as an FBI source.",
      "He denied any involvement in the matter and has pleaded not guilty."

    "sentences": [
      "Trump on Monday again failed to persuade Putin to accept a ceasefire in Ukraine as a first step toward a peace deal.",
      "But what might a deal even look like, and what would it mean for the Ukrainian people?",
      "One of the few explicit peace proposals is a US outline reportedly seen by Reuters last month.",
      "It asks Ukraine to accept de jure recognition of Russia’s annexation of Crimea and de facto recognition of its occupation of large parts of several oblasts in the country’s east.",
      "On Monday, Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that Russia is demanding Ukrainian troops abandon five oblasts as a precondition not for peace, but for a ceasefire and the opening of negotiations.",
      "Before the war, those oblasts were home to about 11 million Ukrainians.",
      "To put that into context, we visualised some broadly comparable populated areas in three European countries and one US state, in each case starting from the north-east corner.",
      "The shaded areas represent populations of about 11 million French, British, Italian and US citizens.",
      "For many Ukrainians, the proposal means never being able to return home to areas now occupied by Russians, and accepting that the Ukrainians who remain there, friends and family, become permanently subject to a violent and repressive Russian regime.",
      "Orysia Lutsevych, a researcher at Chatham House, said: “There is strong nationwide sentiment that Russia will want to take more of Ukraine’s territory, so any concessions are only feeding the monster.",
      "Ukrainians know that life under occupation is horrific.",
      "Ukrainians will never agree to legally recognise its occupied land as anything else than illegal brutal annexation.” It is not clear how many people remain in the areas now occupied by the Russians.",
      "In some cases, whole towns have been reduced to rubble in the course of the war, and many Ukrainians fled to safety either in Ukrainian-held territory or in other countries.",
      "The UN says there are 3 million Ukrainians who have been displaced by the conflict inside the country, and a further 6 million abroad.",
      "Vladimir Putin says he wants elections in Ukraine (he wants Volodymyr Zelenskyy voted out).",
      "Where will those 9 million people vote?",
      "As residents of Donetsk, where some of them have not been since 2014?",
      "As residents of Kharkiv?",
      "Lutsevych said: “Elections will need careful preparations because of the many displaced people inside Ukraine and abroad.",
      "Ukraine must protect its reputation as an electoral democracy.",
      "If elections are rushed too soon and are not properly prepared, Ukrainians will question their legitimacy.",
      "This is exactly what Putin wants – a failed state with disorder that cannot govern itself.",
      "There is no demand for early elections now and the pressure from the US and Russia looks like interference in Ukraine’s sovereignty.” One of the most alarming aspects of these proposals for Ukraine is that they create unfinished business, which hampers reconstruction.",
      "On the Russian side, a Putin who is neither defeated nor chastened can be expected to try again, or at the very least to go back to meddling in Ukrainian politics, as he did in the years leading up to 2014.",
      "Even on the Ukrainian side, a deal that is seen as illegitimate can create instability and a desire to reopen the question.",
      "Security guarantees by Europe or the US, meanwhile, need to be backed up with real force to be credible, and they need to be a believably long-term commitment to make a difference.",
      "Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe at the analysts Eurasia Group, said: “The key question for Ukraine is this: will there be a credible security guarantee which will enable private capital to flow back into the country?",
      "The only security guarantee that Putin’s hasn’t challenged is [Nato’s] article 5, and that’s why Ukrainians are determined to join Nato.",
      "Absent such a guarantee, you don’t get private capital returning and there can be no reconstruction.” Domestic stability is important, too.",
      "Lutsevych said: “Russian territorial occupations fester and obstruct reform and democratic consolidation, which is key for joining both the EU and Nato.",
      "The risk of instability scares FDI [foreign direct investment].",
      "“Ukrainians see the EU first of all as an instructional modernisation project and a way to eradicate corruption.",
      "Nato is more related to collective security but it does have a strong economic effect.",
      "In order to rebuild Ukraine, it is key for Kyiv to succeed in the EU accession process.",

      "The security of our Baltic allies is also our security.” The deployment, unprecedented for the Bundeswehr, is aimed at shoring up the defence of Lithuania and fellow Baltic republics Estonia and Latvia, former Soviet states that have become Nato and EU members and which fear a Russian attack.",

      "Merz, the first chancellor to have himself served in the Bundeswehr, said: “We stand firmly by Ukraine but we also stand together as Europeans as a whole and we play, whenever possible, as a team with the US.” The commitment to Baltic security has posed several challenges for Germany, including finding enough personnel willing to serve there.",

      "In the last ten minutes, they got into the weeds of an apartment scandal that rocked Nawrocki’s campaign with questions over the circumstances in which he bought an apartment from an elderly man, and suggestions that he failed to meet his obligations to provide care as part of the transaction.",
      "He repeatedly denies all allegations.",
      "In his closing statement, Nawrocki says the run off will be “the most important election since 1989,” and I think that will be a sentiment shared by both sides of the campaign.",
      "But 90 minutes on, that’s it.",
      "Let’s leave it then and check on other news across Europe.",
      "If you’re wondering why we are carrying these comments at length: backed by the populist-right Law and Justice party which ran Poland 2015 to 2023, Nawrocki is almost 50/50 to be Poland’s next president, which would have substantial consequences for the EU and Nato (as per earlier comments on Ukraine).",
      "And he has just signed the eight-point manifesto proposed by Mentzen (12:45), as he hopes to win over his supporters and consolidate the right-wing electorate, which accounted for about 52% of votes in the first round.",
      "It’s worth keeping an eye on this.",
      "They should be wrapping up soon.",
      "Asked about the EU, Nawrocki strongly criticises plans for a more federal EU including any proposals to “build European army,” as he says that this push to “centralise” the EU is “a threat to our sovereignty.” He goes on a longer broadside there directly criticising the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen for her track record as German defence minister, and even ticks off Belgium for its colonial past with King Leopold II saying the country is not in a position to teach him about “tolerance and openness.” “I can’t imagine that in 20 years we would become EU citizens of Polish origin,” he says, adding “these tendencies are very dangerous for Poland.” He makes claims about German problems with migration, and quips that “instead of migrant integration services, I propose illegal migrant removal centres.” Nawrocki says that any discussion on Ukraine’s fast-tracked and “unconditional” accession to Nato is “pointless” and would put the alliance in direct conflict with Russia.",
      "He says he remains opposed to it, even if he wants Ukraine to be “part of the western civilisation,” but caveats that by a long-term perspective of “decades” and “in an ideal world.” Comparing himself to the incumbent conservative president, Andrzej Duda, he says: “I am more critical towards Ukraine.” To give you a taster of what to expect from Karol Nawrocki, who could be the next Polish president after June 1, the pair begins by agreeing on extended criticism of the EU’s New Green Deal, rejection of any migration from Muslim-majority countries to Poland, and their shared opposition to extended animal rights and Covid closures in 2020 and 2021.",
      "Nawrocki also directly commits he would not send any Polish troops to Ukraine.",
      "He slightly hesitates when asked if he would resist that even if directly asked to do by US president Donald Trump, but ultimately sticks to the original line.",
      "Mentzen clearly wants to push Nawrocki, endorsed by the populist-right Law and Justice party, to criticise the last government of this party – and succeeds, at least to a certain extent.",
      "Nawrocki occassionally adds some caveats – for example, saying that it’s much easier to criticise lockdowns with hindsight or when discussing proposals for ad valorem taxation on properties – but goes above and beyond to find similarities with Mentzen as he is determined to court this right-wing electorate.",
      "Not surprisingly.",
      "And don’t just take my word for how potentially significant this Mentzen broadcast is for the Polish presidential race: it’s carried live by all major news broadcasters, with more than 200,000 people also watching it live on YouTube.",
      "They are starting their chat now.",
      "I will bring you the key updates here.",
      "Next up, I will take you to Poland, where libertarian far-right candidate Sławomir Mentzen is about to host one of the remaining two candidates on his YouTube channel as he decides who, if anyone, to endorse before the run-off on 1 June.",
      "Mentzen, who came third in the first round of the presidential election last weekend with 14.81% of the vote, will speak to the conservative candidate Karol Nawrocki, endorsed by the populist-right Law and Justice party, at the top of the hour.",
      "Later this week, he will also host the winner of the first round vote, the centrist Warsaw mayor Rafał Trzaskowski.",
      "Ahead of the two conversations, Mentzen had listed eight demands to both presidential candidates.",
      "He wants them to promise to block any laws proposing to raise taxes, reduce use of cash, or expand content moderation laws.",
      "He also wants his rivals to commit to not sending any Polish troops to Ukraine and to blocking Ukraine’s accession to Nato.",
      "On EU, he wants them to pledge they wouldn’t “transfer any competences of Polish authorities to EU bodies” nor sign any new treaties “weakening Poland’s role.” Mentzen’s potential endorsement could play a significant role in the second round as all polls suggest that literally every vote could count given we expect the run-off to be extremely close.",
      "It could also help the voters of the fourth candidate, far-right leader Grzegorz Braun, to make their minds up, as they share some of his views.",

      "Head of strategy of Finnish defence forces says they are monitoring Moscow’s manoeuvring ‘very closely’ Finland has said it expects Russia to further build up troops along their shared border when the war in Ukraine ends, after reports that Moscow had strengthened its military bases near the Nato frontier.",
      "Maj Gen Sami Nurmi, the head of strategy of the Finnish defence forces, said the military is following Moscow’s manoeuvring “very closely” and that it was their job, as part of the Nato alliance, to “prepare for the worst”.",
      "The Finnish border guard announced on Wednesday it had completed the first 35km (22 miles) of a planned 200km fence on its eastern border with Russia, which has been closed for more than a year after Helsinki accused Moscow of directing asylum seekers to Finland in a “hybrid operation”.",
      "The fence also uses cameras and sensors to distinguish between people and animals crossing.",
      "Satellite images, published in the New York Times, appear to show an expansion of military infrastructure near the Finnish border, including rows of tents, military vehicles, renovations to fighter jet shelters and construction on a previously unused helicopter base.",
      "Nurmi said: “They are changing structures and we are seeing moderate preparations when it comes to building infrastructure close to our borders, meaning that they will, once the war in Ukraine hopefully ends, start to bring back the forces that have been fighting in Ukraine, especially land forces.” While this was not unexpected since Finland joined Nato at record speed in 2023 after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Nurmi said they were following the preparations “very closely”.",
      "“They are doing it in phases.",
      "I would say it is still moderate numbers.",
      "It’s not big construction, but in certain places building new infrastructure and preparing, bringing new equipment in,” he said.",
      "“You also have to evaluate whether they are preparing to send more troops to Ukraine or preparing to build up their forces close to our border.",
      "But I guess they are doing both.” Responding to Russia’s changing activities, Donald Trump told reporters on Tuesday he was “not worried about it at all”, adding that Finland and Norway were “going to be very safe”.",
      "Echoing the president’s sentiment, Nurmi said there was “no immediate military threat towards Finland or Nato from this direction”.",
      "He added: “What happened right after the Ukrainian attack was we applied for Nato membership and then when we were accepted Russia announced they would start to change their military posture across the border.” Finnish citizens have become accustomed to the looming threat from its eastern neighbour but hundreds are still signing up for training courses to prepare for emergency situations.",

      "But Suvi Aksela, Nasta’s communications and organisation manager, said the border buildup was not a big talking point in Helsinki.",
      "“It is not very alarming for us,” she said.",
      "“We are used to hearing stuff from Russia, like all these threats, and we knew once we joined Nato they said they were going to build up presence on the border, and they probably will, just because it’s Russia.”"

      "“The longer Russia wages war, the tougher our response,” she said.",
      "Western countries imposed an embargo on Russia’s oil industry after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and banned services for ships transporting Russian crude.",

      "A previously unreported Ukrainian white paper to be presented to the EU calls for the 27-member bloc to take a more aggressive and independent position on sanctions as uncertainty hangs over Washington’s future role.",
      "According to Reuters, among 40 pages of recommendations were calls to adopt legislation that would speed up the EU’s seizure of assets from sanctioned individuals, and send them to Ukraine.",
      "Those under sanctions could then seek compensation from Russia.",
      "The EU should consider a range of steps to make its sanctions apply more forcefully beyond its own territory, including targeting foreign companies that use its technology to help Russia, and “the introduction of secondary sanctions on purchasers of Russian oil”.",
      "Such secondary sanctions, which could hit big buyers such as India and China, would be a major step that Europe has so far been reluctant to take.",
      "Trump had publicly discussed this before taking the decision not to act for now, reports Reuters.",
      "The white paper also calls for the EU to consider using more majority-rules decision making over sanctions, to prevent individual member states from blocking measures that otherwise require unanimity.",
      "After speaking to Vladimir Putin on Monday, Trump opted not to impose fresh sanctions on Russia, dashing hopes of European leaders and Kyiv who had been lobbying him for weeks to ratchet up pressure on Moscow.",
      "Trump spoke to Ukrainian and European leaders after his call with Putin and told them he did not want to impose sanctions now and to give time for talks to take place, a person familiar with conversation told Reuters.",

      "Pope Leo XIV, elected two weeks ago, said on 14 May that the Vatican could act as a mediator in global conflicts, without specifically mentioning Russia’s war against Ukraine.",
      "Here are some other key developments: Separately the Italian prime minister said she had talks with other European leaders and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, over next steps.",
      "“It was agreed to maintain close coordination between the partners with a view to a new round of negotiations aimed at a ceasefire and a peace agreement in Ukraine.” Zelenskyy accused Russia of “trying to buy time” to continue the war, a day after the US president, Donald Trump, discussed the war with Putin.",
      "Their two-hour phone call failed to deliver any meaningful concessions from Moscow.",
      "The German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, also accused Vladimir Putin of “playing for time” and not really being interested in peace in Ukraine.",

      "Tuesday 20 May 2025 19:25, UK The UK and EU have placed fresh sanctions on Russia as the Kremlin refused to put a timeline on ceasefire talks with Ukraine.",
      "The UK's Foreign Office said a total of 100 further sanctions will target Russia's military, energy and financial sectors.",
      "The new measures will target the supply chains of Russian weapons systems, including Iskander missiles, Kremlin-funded information operations, financial institutions that help Russia evade sanctions and ships in the Kremlin's \"shadow fleet\" of oil tankers.",
      "Ukraine war latest: Trump has 'red line' for peace talks The Foreign Office said Vladimir Putin had repeatedly fired Iskander missiles into crowded civilian areas \"with a callous disregard for life\", including on 13 April in Sumy when 34 civilians, including children, were killed as some headed to Palm Sunday services.",

      "Sanctions are aimed at entities supporting Russia’s military machine after call failed to deliver meaningful concessions The UK and Europe have announced major sanctions against Russia as it became clear that Monday’s call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had failed to deliver any meaningful concessions from Moscow.",
      "The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Tuesday accused Russia of “trying to buy time in order to continue its war and occupation” as Putin declined to support the US-proposed 30-day unconditional ceasefire already agreed to by Ukraine.",
      "The UK said its sanctions would target dozens of entities “supporting Russia’s military machine, energy exports and information war, as well as financial institutions helping to fund Putin’s invasion of Ukraine”.",
      "“Putin has so far not put in place the full, unconditional ceasefire that President Trump has called for, and which President Zelenskyy endorsed over two months ago,” the Foreign Office said.",
      "Shortly afterwards the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the EU had approved sanctions targeting Russia’s shadow fleet of about 200 vessels and that more sanctions were in the pipeline.",
      "“The longer Russia wages war, the tougher our response,” she said.",
      "Western countries imposed an embargo on Russia’s oil industry after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and banned services for ships transporting Russian crude.",
      "In response, Moscow began relying on a so-called shadow fleet - tankers with murky ownership and often without proper insurance - to continue exports Zelenskyy on Tuesday welcomed the EU sanctions.",
      "“It is important to severely restrict the Russian tanker fleet, which serves to finance killings, as well as all schemes that Russia uses to build up its military industry,” he wrote on his social media channels.",
      "Zelenskyy also said Ukraine had no doubt the war “must end at the negotiating table” but added that there must be clear and realistic proposals on the table and called for more pressure on Russia.",
      "“We are working with partners to put pressure on the Russians to behave differently.",
      "Sanctions matter, and I am grateful to everyone who makes them more tangible for the perpetrators of the war,” he said.",
      "Trump had indicated on Monday following his call with Putin that the US was not ready to join European sanctions efforts.",
      "Responding to the new sanctions, Russia’s foreign ministry accused Europe of trying to prevent the resumption of direct dialogue, adding: “Russia never responds to ultimatums.” The announcement of the new sanctions underlined the failure of Trump’s attempted mediation in the war, as it became clear in Kyiv and other European capitals that Trump had in effect accepted Putin’s defiance of calls for an immediate ceasefire.",
      "Instead, Trump placed the onus on Kyiv and Moscow to negotiate between themselves, perhaps under the auspices of papal mediation.",
      "Trump was at pains on Monday to emphasise the “excellent” call he had with Putin, suggesting that talks between the two sides would begin “immediately”, but it quickly became clear that he had backed away from any demand that Russia declare an immediate ceasefire.",
      "Describing future talks, Trump said: “The conditions will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of.” Trump’s comments appeared to reflect a waning enthusiasm for engagement with attempts to end the war in Ukraine, after comments from the White House that he was “weary and frustrated”, and he again threatened that he was “just going to back away” after the call with Putin.",
      "Trump appeared to again defer to Moscow by backing Putin’s call for negotiations between Ukraine and Russia.",
      "According to a report on the Axios website, European leaders – including the leaders of Germany, France, Italy, Finland and the European Commission – who joined a subsequent call with Zelenskyy were “surprised” by Trump’s depiction of his conversation with Putin.",
      "It reported that according to its sources “Trump seemed relatively content with what he heard from Putin, and presented it as a new development, even though the Russian leader did not seem to have changed his position at all.” Russia has continued to insist both before and after the call that agreements on its long-held and maximalist demands are a precondition for a possible temporary ceasefire.",
      "That was underlined by the remarks of the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, that there was “no timeline” for preparing a memorandum for future talks.",
      "“It’s clear that everyone wants to do this as quickly as possible, but of course the devil is in the details,” he told reporters after the call.",
      "On Tuesday, Russia appeared to put up yet another hurdle, saying that having suggested working on a memorandum to end the war it was up to Ukraine to cooperate with the peace accord Moscow was proposing.",
      "At a press briefing on Monday night, Zelenskyy confirmed reports from last week’s inconclusive talks in Istanbul between the two sides that Russia was demanding that Ukraine withdraw its forces from five regions, including territory not occupied by Russia.",
      "“It’s our land, we won’t withdraw our troops from our territory … it means that they don’t want peace … if they demand what they know we won’t agree to,” Zelenskyy said.",
      "The inconclusive outcome of the call underlined growing concern among senior officials in Kyiv that the US has been consistently out-gamed by Putin with his clear vision of his objectives, not least since Trump took office.",
      "Trump’s failure to put pressure on Putin has confirmed the fears of officials in Kyiv that Trump is more interested in future business deals with Russia than using US influence to secure a quick ceasefire.",
      "With the US at best semi-detached, Ukraine is focusing its efforts on persuading Europe to match its rhetoric against Moscow with more sanctions and military aid."

      "The Russian leader is a master manipulator.",
      "Until he is forced to face reality, there is no hope of ending the bloodshed After more than three years of stalled diplomacy, the past few days have brought a flurry of activity in the Russia-Ukraine peace process – sadly none of it with any meaningful progress.",
      "The much-anticipated Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul – billed as the first serious negotiations since 2022 – came and went with little more than symbolic fanfare.",
      "The subsequent two-hour phone call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin on Monday concluded with Trump appearing to withdraw from mediating the peace talks altogether.",
      "Once again, the Russian president got what he wanted without even showing up to a meeting that he himself requested.",
      "Trump’s statement that “the conditions for [the peace] will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be” sounded like the opposite of his boast last year that only he could end this war, and in a single day at that.",
      "Even more jarring was Trump’s emphasis on the economic opportunities that Russia offers – tone-deaf, given the scale of Russian atrocities, and a slap in the face to the US’s European allies.",
      "If Trump is indeed stepping back from his self-appointed role as mediator, as his press release suggested, that would be a welcome shift from his earlier efforts to force Ukraine into a deal on Russia’s terms.",
      "Any move away from that is a move in Ukraine’s favour.",
      "Ukraine can and should holds its own in negotiations with Russia.",
      "At the same time, anybody hoping for successful direct Russia-Ukraine negotiations should temper their expectations.",
      "Putin has no interest in genuine negotiations, and likely never will.",
      "He has repeatedly refused to meet Zelenskyy – not because there’s no agenda, but because acknowledging Ukraine’s leader would mean recognising Ukraine’s sovereignty.",
      "In Putin’s imperial worldview, Ukraine isn’t a country and therefore cannot have a legitimate government.",
      "This from a man whose own political legitimacy is propped up by ballot stuffing and electoral spectacle rivalling the Bolshoi theatre.",
      "Scholars of international conflict often describe war and negotiation as two sides of the same coin.",
      "War is, in essence, a costly information-gathering process.",
      "It reveals and establishes the ground truth – each side’s capabilities – which helps to identify the range of peace deals that both sides might prefer to continued fighting.",
      "The key to getting an upper hand in peace negotiations, therefore, is to use the battlefield to demonstrate your capacity to win, thereby compelling the other side to cut their losses and make concessions at the negotiating table.",
      "But after three years of war, it is Russia – not Ukraine – that has been confronted by the limits of its power.",
      "The so-called “second most powerful army in the world” has failed to achieve its strategic objectives.",
      "Since January, Russia’s territorial advances have amounted a handful of fields and abandoned villages, totalling under 1,000 sq km.",
      "And its economy is crumbling under the weight of sanctions and mobilisation.",
      "After the failure of his original plan of “take Kyiv in three days”, Putin’s plan B appears to amount to speaking with confidence and hoping for luck.",
      "Ukraine, by contrast, has proved to be stronger and more resilient than many expected.",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has forged an impressive international coalition.",
      "Ukraine successfully withstood Russia’s initial assault, recovered key territory and stabilised much of the frontline.",
      "Its performance on the battlefield has shifted perceptions of its strength and bolstered its negotiating position.",
      "Yet Russia continues to cling to its maximalist demands of demilitarisation, sweeping territorial concessions and regime change.",
      "Putin refuses to revise his war aims in light of battlefield evidence.",
      "He continues to demand territories he is unable to take by force, as if he can make them his by simply claiming they are his.",
      "So, what is he doing?",
      "To understand the Russian leader’s logic, we need to first understand the domestic political context in which he operates.",
      "Unlike a democratically elected leader, Putin faces no real checks from domestic institutions or the public.",
      "His only political constraint is the inner circle of elites who keep him in power – military and conservative figures with an imperialist worldview.",
      "To them, Ukraine is not just any territory to be divided in proportion to battlefield success.",
      "Rather, it is a coveted prize, central to restoring Russia’s lost greatness.",
      "Civilian casualties and economic pain are secondary concerns.",
      "Concessions, in this worldview, are not just unnecessary – they are unthinkable.",
      "As Russia’s chief negotiator in Istanbul, Vladimir Medinsky, told the Ukrainian delegation: “[Russia] fought with Sweden for 21 years.” The message is that Putin is prepared to wait.",
      "But he’s hoping he won’t have to wait 21 years.",

      "He demands the moon, then lashes out when it is not delivered.",
      "What he is, however, is a master manipulator.",
      "He believes that if he cannot take Ukrainian territory by force, he can secure it through narrative – by convincing sympathetic voices in the west that Russia deserves it anyway.",
      "From Crimea to the Minsk agreements, from Syria to Chechnya, Putin has built his legacy on making up facts on the ground and daring the world to challenge them.",

      "Nicuşor Dan begins process of forming a government after beating George Simion, an ultranationalist who wants to halt Ukraine support The centrist mayor of Bucharest, Nicuşor Dan, has begun sounding out Romania’s political parties over forming a new majority government after winning the country’s presidential election in a surprise result greeted with relief across the EU.",
      "With all votes counted on Monday morning, Dan, who had described the second round vote as a battle between “a pro-western and an anti-western Romania”, scored 53.6%, official figures showed, against 46.4% for his far-right rival George Simion.",
      "Dan, 55, a quietly-spoken mathematician who has been the capital’s independent mayor since 2020, came from behind to win after losing heavily to Simion, a brash, EU-critical Trump admirer who had wanted to halt aid to Ukraine, in the first round.",
      "At nearly 65%, turnout was the highest in a Romanian election for a quarter of a century, reflecting the importance of a vote with huge consequences for the country’s strategic alignment and economic prospects, as well as for EU unity.",
      "Staunchly pro-EU and pro-Nato, Dan had campaigned on a pledge to fight corruption, maintain support for neighbouring Ukraine – where Romania has played an important logistical role – and keep the country firmly within the western mainstream.",
      "“It’s a victory of thousands and thousands of people who … believe that Romania can change in the right direction,” he told his supporters after the outcome became clear, while calling for “hope and patience” as the country faced “a difficult period ahead”.",
      "Simion, a former soccer ultra and ultranationalist agitator, at first refused to concede, claiming on social media on Sunday: “I am the new president of Romania.” But he later acknowledged Dan “won the election, and this was the will of the Romanian people”.",
      "The far-right candidate vowed, however, to “continue the fight for freedom and our great values along with other patriots, sovereignists and conservatives all over the world.",
      "We may have lost a battle, but we will certainly not lose the war.” EU leaders congratulated Dan.",
      "The European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the result would help “a strong Europe”, while the European Council president, António Costa, called it “a strong signal of Romanians’ attachment to the European project”.",
      "The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said Romania had “chosen democracy, the rule of law, and the European Union”.",
      "Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, also congratulated Dan, saying it was “important to have Romania as a reliable partner”.",
      "The result deprives Hungary’s illiberal leader, Viktor Orbán, the EU’s disrupter-in-chief, and Slovakia’s Robert Fico – both of whom oppose military aid for Ukraine – of a new ally in key decisions on the war, energy, EU enlargement and the bloc’s budget.",
      "The election came nearly six months after an initial vote was annulled amid evidence of campaign finance irregularities and a “massive” Russian interference campaign in favour of its far-right winner, Călin Georgescu, who was banned from standing again.",
      "Simion had said that if he won he would nominate the Moscow-friendly Georgescu, who is under investigation on six counts including misreporting campaign spending, illegal use of digital technology and promoting fascist groups, as prime minister.",
      "Cristian Preda, a professor of politics at the University of Bucharest, said the result reflected voters’ concern that “for the first time in Romania’s electoral history, we had a potential president who was openly supported by Moscow”.",
      "Preda said a clear majority of about 60% of voters were deeply disillusioned with Romania’s mainstream centre-left Socials Democrats (PSD) and centre-right Liberals (PNL) – but that a similar proportion were also solidly pro-European and anti-Russian.",
      "“Voters were faced with a choice between the positions of the Kremlin, and those of Brussels,” he said.",
      "“Dan was pro-western and represented neither of the big parties, in an election in which security was key.",
      "For me, the result was never really in doubt.” Dan faces a daunting in-tray and a tough challenge finding a prime minister to form a majority in parliament to reduce Romania’s budget deficit – the largest in the EU – as well as to reassure investors and markets spooked by a possible Simion win.",
      "Romanian presidents have a semi-executive role, with considerable powers over foreign policy, national security, defence spending and judicial appointments, and can also dissolve parliament if MPs reject two prime ministerial nominations.",
      "Simion’s victory in the 4 May first round triggered the collapse of Romania’s PSD-PNL ruling coalition.",
      "Local media suggested Dan would first seek to form a new majority with the two main parties and a prime minister from his Save Romania Union (USR).",
      "Failing that, he may work towards a minority coalition with the Liberals, with a confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Social Democrats.",
      "He has ruled out any cooperation with Simion’s AUR party, the second largest in parliament.",
      "The voting in Romania took place on the same day as the first round of a Polish election in which a liberal frontrunner, Rafał Trzaskowski, edged ahead of Karol Nawrocki, who was backed by the opposition nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party.",
      "Trzaskowski did worse than expected, with final results showing he scored 31.36% to Nawrocki’s 29.54%.",
      "Since Polish presidents can veto laws passed by parliament, the 1 June runoff will determine prime minister Donald Tusk’s ability to push through his reformist, pro-EU agenda."

      "You can read more of our US politics coverage here At least 50 Venezuelan men sent by the Trump administration to a prison in El Salvador had entered the United States legally, according to a review by the Cato Institute, a libertarian thinktank.",
      "The report, published today, analyzed available immigration data for only a portion of the men who were deported, and focuses on the cases where records could be found.",
      "“The government calls them all ‘illegal aliens.’ But of the 90 cases where the method of crossing is known, 50 men report that they came legally to the United States, with advanced US government permission, at an official border crossing point,” Cato said in its report.",
      "This number aligns with broader trends among Venezuelan migrants, many of whom entered the country either as refugees or through a Biden-era parole program that granted two-year work permits to those with US-based sponsors.",
      "“The proportion isn’t what matters the most: the astounding absolute numbers are,” reads the report.",
      "“Dozens of legal immigrants were stripped of their status and imprisoned in El Salvador.” Cato’s analysis goes against the Trump administration’s justification for sending the men to El Salvador, saying that only undocumented immigrants were deported.",
      "The report says that 21 men were admitted after presenting themselves at a port of entry, 24 were granted parole, four were resettled as refugees, and one entered the US on a tourist visa.",
      "To date, the Trump administration has not released complete records for the more than 200 Venezuelans transferred to El Salvador.",
      "Cato’s review includes information for 174 men whose cases have some degree of public documentation.",
      "The Trump administration has accused many of the deported Venezuelan men of gang involvement, but in many cases, those claims appear to hinge largely on their tattoos.",
      "Many of the tattoos cited as evidence have no connection to gang activity.",
      "The markings reflect, in many cases, personal or cultural references.",
      "Cato uses the example of Andry José Hernández Romero, a makeup artist, who has crown tattoos on his arms that reference the Three Kings Day celebrations in his Venezuelan hometown.",

      "“I said: ‘That’s really clever,’” Comey recounted in a Monday interview on MSNBC, describing the events that led him to post a photo of the seashells on Instagram, leading to a firestorm of accusations from Donald Trump allies that he was calling for violence against the 47th president of the United States.",
      "“I posted it on my Instagram account and thought nothing more of it, until I heard through her that people were saying it was some sort of a call for assassination, which is crazy.",
      "But I took it down.",
      "Even if I think it’s crazy, I don’t want to be associated with violence of any kind,” he said.",
      "Comey was hoping for a buzz around his forthcoming legal thriller, FDR Drive: A Crime Novel.",
      "Instead he got a call from the Secret Service.",
      "Comey, who was fired by Trump in his first term, appeared voluntarily at the Washington field office for an interview, after the US president insisted there was no innocent reading of the message.",
      "“He knew exactly what that meant.",
      "A child knows what that meant,” Trump said.",
      "“If you’re the FBI director and you don’t know what that meant, that meant assassination.",
      "And it says it loud and clear.” Comey appeared nonplussed by the investigation – “it’s not my first rodeo,” he said, noting his tempestuous relationship with Trump which Comey said deteriorated after he rebuffed Trump’s early attempts to secure a pledge of loyalty from the then-FBI director.",
      "The agency is now led by Kash Patel, whose abiding loyalty has raised urgent questions about the FBI’s independence.",
      "But Comey warned that the episode pointed to a more worrying trend by this administration: “The use of power to aim at individuals, eroding the rule of law.” His advice to others who may find themselves on the receiving end of Trump’s retribution?",
      "“The rule of law is still our saving grace,” Comey said.",
      "“We have a judiciary in this country that will support the truth.",
      "Take solace in that.",
      "Take prudent steps, but don’t freak out.",
      "These people are not good enough for you to be freaked out about.",
      "Protect yourself, be measured about the effect the threat has on you, and know that you’re going to be OK.” Donald Trump is delivering a speech at the Kennedy Center board dinner about three months after he seized control of the entity and immediately terminated multiple people from the board of trustees, making himself the chair of a new board.",
      "On Monday, he took a moment to criticize the center’s layout.",
      "“The importance of the building is phenomenal,” he said.",
      "“I always thought they should have built a beautiful performing center, open air, facing out over the Potomac.",
      "They didn’t do that.",
      "They built these crazy rooms underneath.",
      "They built three tiny little stages, very expensive.",
      "Someday, maybe somebody will occupy one.” The Kennedy Center is the country’s national cultural center and is run through a public-private partnership.",
      "The center is known for hosting music, theater, dance, artwork and performance art, and has hosted acts ranging from Tina Turner to Led Zeppelin.",
      "Trump’s move to take control made performers cancel shows, donors question their support and audience members threaten to boycott.",
      "The new board is stocked with loyalists, including White House chief of staff Susie Wiles; attorney general Pam Bondi; Usha Vance, the wife of JD Vance; and Lee Greenwood, whose song God Bless the USA,” plays at Trump rallies as well as many official events, including during his trip to the Middle East last week.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security conducted its first charter flight for migrants who opted to “self-deport” to their home countries, flying 64 Colombians and Hondurans home.",
      "The department paid them a $1,000 stipend each.",
      "“This was a voluntary charter flight, not an ICE enforcement operation,” DHS said in a press release, referring to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced it would begin offering travel assistance and a stipend for those registering to self-deport through the CBP Home App.",
      "That is a version of the app devised in the Biden administration called CBPOne that gave people approaching the US-Mexico border without official arrangements a strictly limited channel to request asylum in the US and enter legally when issued an appointment.",
      "Donald Trump shut that down upon inauguration, as vowed, stranding many, and later changed its name and function so that CBP Home is a tool to exit the US, not enter.",
      "In Colombia, 26 people arrived to their families and representatives of the Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Migration Colombia, according to officials.",
      "In Honduras, 38 people were received by government officials and family members.",
      "Columbia University student Mohsen Mahdawi, who was detained by federal immigration authorities last month over his pro-Palestinian activism, crossed the graduation stage on Monday.",
      "Several students cheered for Mahdawi as he walked across the stage.",
      "He blew a kiss and bowed, one video showed.",
      "Mahdawi was arrested by Ice in Colchester, Vermont, while attending a naturalization interview.",
      "He was detained and ordered deported by the Trump administration on 14 April despite not being charged with a crime.",
      "He is one of several international students who have been detained in recent months for their advocacy on behalf of Palestinians.",
      "The Trump administration is attempting to deport them using an obscure statute that gives the secretary of state the right to revoke the legal status of people in the country deemed a threat to foreign policy.",
      "Donald Trump said on Monday that he was surprised the public wasn’t notified sooner about former president Joe Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis.",
      "“I think it’s very sad,” the US president said.",
      "“I’m surprised that it wasn’t notified a long time ago.",
      "Because to get to stage nine, it’s a long time.” Biden disclosed on Sunday he was diagnosed with prostate cancer with metastasis to the bone, and he and his family are reviewing treatment options.",
      "Trump then said he just had his physical and said he was “proud to announce I aced” the cognitive tests, saying: “I got them all right.” “I think, frankly, anybody running for president should, you know, take a cognitive test,” he said.",
      "Donald Trump said he didn’t think Pope Leo XIV’s involvement in Russia-Ukraine peace talks meant the US would play a smaller role.",
      "He liked the idea of holding negotiations at the Vatican.",
      "“I think it would be great to have it at the Vatican,” Trump said.",
      "“Maybe it would have some extra significance … I think it would be maybe helpful.",
      "There’s tremendous bitterness, anger, and I think maybe that could help with some of that anger.",
      "So having it in the Vatican would be – in Rome – would be a great, I think it’d be great idea.” Trump said he asked Russian president Vladimir Putin to meet with him.",
      "“I said: ‘When are we going to end this bloodshed, this bloodbath.",
      "It’s a bloodbath.’ And I do believe he wants to end it.” At least 50 Venezuelan men sent by the Trump administration to a prison in El Salvador had entered the United States legally, according to a review by the Cato Institute, a libertarian thinktank.",
      "The report, published today, analyzed available immigration data for only a portion of the men who were deported, and focuses on the cases where records could be found.",
      "“The government calls them all ‘illegal aliens.’ But of the 90 cases where the method of crossing is known, 50 men report that they came legally to the United States, with advanced US government permission, at an official border crossing point,” Cato said in its report.",
      "This number aligns with broader trends among Venezuelan migrants, many of whom entered the country either as refugees or through a Biden-era parole program that granted two-year work permits to those with US-based sponsors.",
      "“The proportion isn’t what matters the most: the astounding absolute numbers are,” reads the report.",
      "“Dozens of legal immigrants were stripped of their status and imprisoned in El Salvador.” Cato’s analysis goes against the Trump administration’s justification for sending the men to El Salvador, saying that only undocumented immigrants were deported.",
      "The report says that 21 men were admitted after presenting themselves at a port of entry, 24 were granted parole, four were resettled as refugees, and one entered the US on a tourist visa.",
      "To date, the Trump administration has not released complete records for the more than 200 Venezuelans transferred to El Salvador.",
      "Cato’s review includes information for 174 men whose cases have some degree of public documentation.",
      "The Trump administration has accused many of the deported Venezuelan men of gang involvement, but in many cases, those claims appear to hinge largely on their tattoos.",
      "Many of the tattoos cited as evidence have no connection to gang activity.",
      "The markings reflect, in many cases, personal or cultural references.",
      "Cato uses the example of Andry José Hernández Romero, a makeup artist, who has crown tattoos on his arms that reference the Three Kings Day celebrations in his Venezuelan hometown.",
      "The Department of Justice has launched an investigation into a recent security breach at Coinbase Global, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Bloomberg reports.",
      "Coinbase itself is not the subject of the justice department’s investigation, which is focused on the people behind the attack.",
      "“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” Paul Grewal, chief legal officer at Coinbase, told Reuters.",
      "Last week, Coinbase disclosed that on 11 May it received an email from an unidentified threat actor claiming to have information on certain customer accounts and internal documents.",
      "The company estimates potential losses from the incident to range between $180m and $400m.",
      "While the attackers stole some data including names, addresses and emails, they did not get access to login credentials or passwords.",
      "It will, however, reimburse the customers who were tricked into sending funds to the attackers.",
      "Here’s more information on the cyber-attack: An anonymous source told the AP that President Donald Trump is slated to visit House Republicans during their weekly conference meeting on Tuesday as he looks to build momentum for his tax cut and immigration bill.",
      "The legislation Republicans are hoping to pass this summer faces a critical test in the House this week with Speaker Mike Johnson seeking a vote before Memorial Day, even though GOP lawmakers still have some differences on the bill.",
      "Johnson is working to hold his narrow House majority together to pass the president’s top domestic priority of extending the tax breaks while pumping in money for border security and deportations.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer introduced new legislation that would ban the United States from using a foreign plane as Air Force One.",
      "Schumer is introducing the bill in an effort to prevent President Donald Trump from accepting a new $400 million plane from Qatar.",
      "“Retrofitting the Qatari plane would cost billions and could never even truly eliminate all catastrophic risks,” Schumer said on X.",
      "White House Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that the aircraft “will be accepted according to all legal and ethical obligations.” The bill would prevent the US from spending taxpayer dollars to retrofit a foreign-owned plane for presidential use.",
      "“There’s absolutely no amount of modifications that can guarantee it will be secure,” Schumer said.",
      "Speaking in the White House Rose Garden on Monday, Trump said: “We just spent two and a half hours talking to Vladimir Putin and I think some progress has been made.",
      "It’s a terrible situation going on over there.",
      "Five thousand young people every single week are being killed so hopefully we did something.",
      "“We also spoke to the heads of most of the European nations and we’re trying to get that whole thing wrapped up.",
      "What a shame that it ever started in the first place.” The president was about to sign a bill that addresses the rise of “revenge porn” and deepfake images and was joined by first lady Melania Trump, who has campaigned on the issue.",
      "Trump quipped: “Putin just said, they respect your wife a lot.",
      "I said, what about me?",
      "They like Melania better.",
      "That wasn’t good; I don’t know if that was good.",
      "I’m OK with it.",
      "I’m OK.” Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, compared federal immigration enforcement under Donald Trump with Nazi-era police tactics during a commencement address over the weekend.",
      "“Donald Trump’s modern-day Gestapo is scooping folks up off the streets,” Walz said on Saturday during the University of Minnesota Law School graduation.",
      "Walz, who was the Democratic vice-presidential nominee last fall, added: “They’re in unmarked vans, wearing masks, being shipped off to foreign torture dungeons, no chance to mount a defense, not even a chance to kiss a loved one goodbye, just grabbed up by masked agents, shoved into those vans, and disappeared.” Walz’s remarks referred to the Trump administration’s expedited deportations of migrants and pro-Palestinian student activists on college campuses, largely carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.",
      "Since Trump took office, several videos have surfaced online showing officers conducting ambush-style arrests."

      "In the post-Soviet states, statues can be removed and street names changed.",
      "But achieving sovereignty of memory is far harder We often hear that it is Russia’s inability or unwillingness to deal with the crimes of its past that has led to the restoration of tyranny and the military aggression that we see now.",
      "Such a narrative usually focuses only on internal Soviet deeds: forced collectivisation, the Great Terror of the 1930s, the Gulag system and so on.",
      "Some of these things were nominally recognised as crimes, but no attempt was made to hold the perpetrators to account.",
      "Russia’s perestroika democrats were generally opposed to transitional justice.",
      "However, the most politically sensitive Soviet crime is nearly always left out of the discussion.",
      "And Russia’s failure to address this particular crime is far more dangerous and affects the fate of many nations.",
      "That crime is the Soviet occupation of central and eastern Europe, which lasted for decades and resulted in many dead and arrested, the destruction of social and cultural life and the denial of freedom.",
      "The injustice was immense.",
      "Internal Soviet crimes, which went unpunished, were at least legally acknowledged and their victims commemorated.",
      "External aggression and occupation were not.",
      "Аnd even Russian dissidents and liberals never risked raising the issue.",
      "This is why, in relation to central and eastern Europe, there are two concepts of memory and history that normally cannot coexist, that clash with and contradict each other.",
      "They are totally opposed; they cannot be reconciled by diplomacy: Soviet liberation versus Soviet occupation.",
      "It was only when Soviet troops finally withdrew from eastern and central Europe 45 years after the end of the second world war that the true liberation came, when the Soviet Union collapsed and occupied nations found their way to independence.",
      "But it was easier to restore or establish statehood and independence than to achieve sovereignty of historical memory.",
      "The progressive image of the Soviet Union in its final days, the high hopes of the moment, shielded Moscow from serious criticism and accusations related to the occupation of eastern Europe.",
      "This restraint was the result of a surfeit of trust or, maybe, just cautionary pragmatism – the desire not to irritate Moscow and undermine its goodwill, not to burden the losers of the cold war too much.",
      "But the most important protection Moscow enjoyed was, of course, based on the status of having been victorious over nazism.",
      "Russia, as the self-proclaimed successor state to the USSR, has built its international political profile on the Soviet liberation myth, which provides moral capital and prescribes to the former occupied territories a debt of gratitude for their “liberation” from nazism.",
      "Yes, the Soviet losses were real.",
      "And yet it is truly tragic that these losses helped to subjugate nations longing for freedom, replacing one dictatorship with another.",
      "The Soviet soldier, memorialised in statues that still mark the landscape of Europe from Berlin to Sofia, was not a liberator.",
      "He was an enslaver.",
      "And no amount of bloodshed by the Soviets to defeat the Nazis can excuse the Soviets’ own role as occupiers.",
      "It is not accidental that the Soviets were reluctant to recognise even the existence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact.",
      "In modern Russia, to make any equivalence between the roles of the USSR and the Nazis is criminalised.",
      "In 1939 and 1940, the Soviet Union occupied Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and parts of Poland, Finland and Romania.",
      "For 22 months it was a faithful ally of Nazi Germany.",
      "This first wave of Soviet occupations can in no way be disguised as a “struggle against nazism”: it revealed the real intention of the Soviets.",
      "What then followed, was, in fact, a geographically extended reoccupation.",
      "This was a separate aim of the war, not necessarily connected to the one to defeat the Nazis.",
      "Unfortunately, understanding the Soviet occupation as a crime has not become an essential part of modern European history.",
      "It is geographically limited to the east, blurred, insufficiently represented; it forms part of the histories of individual nations but it does not form a powerful international narrative shared across the continent.",
      "Yet this understanding has a profound bearing on modern European life and is key to European security.",
      "Only when you fully grasp the cruelty and consequences of the Soviet occupation can you comprehend the concerns of Russia’s closest neighbours, their historically grounded fears and their need for safety.",
      "Eastern regions of Ukraine are now occupied by Russian troops.",
      "For the first time since 1989, large areas of the European continent, home to millions of people, are under the control of an invading state.",

      "Ukrainian prisoners of war released from captivity report the same torture, abuse and deliberate malnutrition aimed at breaking them physically and mentally.",
      "Anyone who knows the history behind the iron curtain immediately recognises the pattern.",
      "All this was a grim reality for Poland and Lithuania, East Germany and Romania and others.",
      "Mass deportations, the brutal rule of the secret police, deprivation of property and civil rights … but it never became a real stigma for the USSR or, later, Russia.",
      "It never became something of which a nation is ashamed, something that demands justice and punishment, acknowledgment and atonement.",
      "And this is where we are now: the occupier is back.",
      "And the occupier wages war exactly like the Soviets did.",
      "Vladimir Putin’s army has a gruesome advantage over western armies, which have invested heavily in keeping their personnel out of harm’s way.",
      "It can sustain losses that would be absolutely unacceptable for any western country.",
      "But it is also technically advanced enough to counter western military technologies.",
      "Western science was the first to “dronise” warfare, to minimise the involvement of troops on the ground and use machines for new tasks.",
      "Putin’s army, while also using real drones, dronises human beings as well.",
      "It has turned soldiers into dispensable, single-use units.",
      "With Russia’s full-scale invasion we have entered the era of global moral climate change.",
      "Just as one earthquake can have repercussions all over the world, or a single volcanic eruption can pollute the skies above several continents, Russia’s aggression changes the political climate worldwide.",
      "This is another very real, but not yet fully recognised, outcome of the war.",
      "It is perhaps the most wide-ranging of all the outcomes.",
      "With thousands of troops sent into battle and killed by Ukrainians defending themselves, Putin doesn’t just get some pieces of Ukrainian territory – he erodes the political landscape worldwide, upsets alliances, exhausts the patience of voters in Nato countries and drags us down into the hell of moral relativism.",

      "The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy again pressed the need for sanctions against Russia in a call with Donald Trump before the US president’s telephone summit with Vladimir Putin of Russia, the British prime minister’s office said.",
      "Trump is to speak with Putin on Monday as part of his long-running effort to end the war set off by Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "“The leaders discussed the need for an unconditional ceasefire and for President Putin to take peace talks seriously,” said a spokesperson for Keir Starmer.",
      "They also discussed the use of sanctions if Russia failed to engage seriously in a ceasefire and peace talks.",
      "Separately, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, met the US vice-president, JD Vance, and secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on Sunday as part of preparations for the Trump-Putin call, Peter Beaumont reports.",
      "The encounter took place on the sidelines of Pope Leo’s inauguration on Sunday.",
      "It came two days after the first direct talks between Ukraine and Russia in over three years in Turkey.",
      "After meeting with Vance, Zelenskyy said: “We discussed the talks in Istanbul, where the Russians sent a low-level delegation with no decision-making powers.",
      "We also touched on the need for sanctions against Russia, bilateral trade, defence cooperation, the situation on the battlefield and the future exchange of prisoners.” A senior official from Zelenskyy’s office said the Rome encounter went “better” than the Oval Office row three months ago when Vance publicly berated Zelensky as being “disrespectful” and not “thankful” enough.",
      "Calls to step up and coordinate action against the unflagged Russian “shadow fleet” of oil tankers in the Baltic Sea were made at the weekend before the EU foreign ministers’ meeting on Monday, which is expected to impose sanctions on 180 ships, writes Patrick Wintour.",
      "On average three loaded shadow tankers a day pass through northern European waters, including the Danish straits and the Channel.",
      "The inclusion of more vessels would take the total number of ships under EU sanctions to 350.",
      "The shadow fleet is estimated to be carrying as much as 85% of Russia’s oil exports and so funding roughly a third of its budget.",
      "The battle over the shadow fleet intensified last week when a Russian Sukhoi Su-35 jet breached Estonian airspace in what looked like a reprisal for a tanker named the Jaguar, likely to be carrying Russian oil, being escorted out of Estonian economic waters by the country’s navy after the crew resisted boarding for inspect.",
      "The Estonian navy believed the ship might pose a threat to nearby underwater cables.",
      "More tanks from Australia are “on their way” to Ukraine, the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, told Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the pope’s inauguration at the Vatican.",
      "“The Russian illegal aggression needs to be resisted and we stand with Ukraine very clearly and unequivocally, and we also have, of course, called for peace.” The Ukrainian president called for Australia to join in placing more sanctions on Russia.",
      "Australia’s ABC news in April reported that delivery of Australia’s retired M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine had been delayed partly by US resistance to their transfer."

      "Alexander Stubb says Putin’s intransigence could pave way for ‘bone-crushing’ sanctions package Donald Trump is losing patience with Vladimir Putin, Finland’s president has said after a lengthy conversation with his US counterpart.",
      "Alexander Stubb said Trump and Putin, who are scheduled to speak by telephone on Monday, must not decide the fate of Ukraine over the head of its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Stubb also said there was a chance, depending on how the phone call goes, that the US senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal would introduce into Congress this week a sanctions package to make Russia’s finances untenable.",
      "Stubb has been in near daily contact with Graham, who describes the sanctions package as “bone-crushing”.",
      "At a security conference in Estonia, Stubb said: “If we were to pull it together, we could say that Zelenskyy is patient and President Trump is starting to be impatient, but in the right direction, that is, towards Russia.” Stubb said threatening sanctions and not implementing them would not cause a credibility problem as long as the west was making Putin react.",
      "It is widely expected that Graham, who discussed his sanctions package with European foreign ministers last week, will adapt the bill’s provisions so it is aimed at foreign firms that import Russian energy.",
      "Graham, a Trump loyalist, is portraying his sanctions as an adjunct to Trump’s tariffs policy and not an alternative.",
      "The initial package contained plans to impose 500% tariffs on the goods of any country trading in energy with Russia, a blunderbuss style of policy Trump has already reversed in his trade war.",
      "Stubb said any European contact with Putin would be through the E3 leadership of Britain, France and Germany.",
      "“At the top level we should not go solo,” he said.",
      "Stubb, one of the small group of European leaders with the ear of Trump, said he had been using his influence to persuade the president to revise his view of Russia’s economic and military strength.",
      "At the Lennart Meri security conference in Tallinn he disclosed that in his conversation with Trump on Saturday he had tried to explain that Russia was no longer a great power, “certainly not economically”.",
      "He added: “It is smaller than Italy, slightly larger than Spain [in terms of its economy].",
      "Militarily it wanted to deny the independent sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine three years ago.",
      "It has advanced less than one percentage point this year, and its interest rate is over 20% and its reserves are out.",
      "“So it is not a country which can be seen as a big power any more.",
      "These are the kind of messages that you have to convey.",
      "It is not an easy game, but you just have to keep on engaging the American administration.",
      "“Trump’s worldview is not far from what we saw in the 19th-century concert of powers – a big power era sometimes of competition and sometimes cooperation.",
      "We have to convince the US administration that free trade and common rules are better than transactional deals, and we show we are serious about defence in Europe and that we are security providers and not security consumers.” Matthew Whitaker, the US ambassador to Nato, told the conference his country was Europe’s friend but warned of a smaller military presence in Europe.",
      "“President Trump just said: enough, this is going to happen and it’s going to happen now,” he said.",
      "“This is going to be orderly, but we are not going to have any more patience for foot-dragging in this situation.",
      "We just need to work through the practical consequences.” The postponement of a US troop withdrawal announcement until after a Nato summit next month will make capability planning more difficult.",
      "Radosław Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, was one of many European leaders who accepted that the rebalancing of defence spending between Europe and the US was long overdue, adding he was grateful to Trump.",
      "He recalled what the Japanese admiral Isoroku Yamamoto said of the Americans after Pearl Harbor – “We have awoken a sleeping giant” – and said: “Putin has also woken the giant.",
      "He has yet no idea how costly this is going to be.",
      "Since President Trump came to power we [Nato] have already doubled our defence spending.",
      "We are at 2% [of GDP].",
      "“At the next Nato summit 3.5 % on hard defence will be the new target and 1.5% for civil and cyber defence.",
      "When we have done it, we will dwarf Russia.",
      "As Europe, without the US, we are spending two and half times more than Russia on a peace footing than Russia is spending on a war footing.",
      "All it takes is to spend the money better, on the basis of learning the lessons from Ukraine and then having the will to gel this into a fighting force.",
      "We should be grateful to the US for telling it like it is.” Stubb added that in his conversations with the US administration, no one had mentioned the US leaving Nato and it was in the interest of the US to have allies in the alliance.",
      "Alar Karis, the Estonian president, revealed he sat next to Trump for two hours at the pope’s funeral in Rome and was told: “Don’t worry, you are safe.” But diplomats warned the Nato summit could bring sharp disagreements over Russia strategy, with Europeans wanting to be clear that Russia posed a long-term threat, regardless of the settlement in Ukraine.",
      "It is not yet clear in what capacity Zelenskyy will attend the summit.",
      "His presence is important for leaders who do not want any peace settlement to rule out Ukrainian membership of Nato."

      "Fleet of tankers sailing under flags of convenience estimated to carry up to 85% of Russia’s oil exports Calls to step up and coordinate action against the unflagged Russian “shadow fleet” of oil tankers in the Baltic Sea were made this weekend before the EU foreign ministers’ meeting on Monday, which is expected to impose sanctions on 180 ships.",
      "The inclusion of those vessels would take the total number of ships under EU sanctions to 350.",
      "Efforts to stop the shadow fleet, which is estimated to be carrying as much as 85% of Russia’s oil exports and so funding roughly a third of its budget, are seen as a critical proof of the EU’s determination to keep the economic pressure on Russia.",
      "The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, spoke on Saturday with the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, over the latest steps against the shadow fleet, a group of 500 or so ageing and poorly insured tankers using flags of convenience to export Russian oil to countries such as India, in defiance of sanctions mounted in 2022 by G7 countries including Canada.",
      "But the Lithuanian foreign minister, Kęstutis Budrys, said current enforcement was ineffective and now faced the threat of Russian military reprisals.",
      "Each day, about three loaded shadow tankers pass through northern European waters, including the Danish straits and the Channel.",
      "In a further sign of tensions, Russian authorities detained a Greek-owned oil tanker on Sunday after it left an Estonian port while sailing on an agreed route in Russia’s territorial waters.",
      "The Liberian-flagged Green Admire tanker had left the port of Sillamäe in north-east Estonia carrying a cargo of shale oil, destined for Rotterdam, in the Netherlands.",
      "Budrys, speaking at the Lennart Meri conference in Tallinn, highlighted uncertainty about the law on interdiction in international waters, and fear of an all-out military confrontation with Russia.",
      "The Estonian defence minister, Hanno Pevkur, called for all ships under sanctions to be debarred from entering EU economic exclusion zone waters, as they are debarred from entering EU ports.",
      "The move would severely restrict the Russian fleet but would arguably breach maritime law.",
      "The battle over the shadow fleet intensified last week when a Russian Sukhoi Su-35 jet flew into Estonia’s airspace in what looked like a reprisal for a tanker named the Jaguar, likely to be carrying Russian oil, being escorted out of Estonian economic waters by the country’s navy.",
      "It was not clear whether the ship, already subject to sanctions by the UK, was sailing without any flag registration, the surest legal ground for interdicting a ship.",
      "The Estonian navy believed the ship might pose a threat to nearby underwater cables, and contacted it to check its status and registration.",
      "Faced by resistance from the Jaguar crew, the Estonians drew back from trying to board the ship to inspect its cargo and instead escorted it into the international waters of the Gulf of Finland on its way to the Russian port of Primorsk.",
      "As the ship was being escorted, a Russian jet entered Estonian airspace for a minute without permission.",
      "It is seen as the first incident in which Russia has shown military force in support of the shadow fleet, and its first entry into Estonian airspace for at least three years.",
      "The fleet is thought to have expanded, possibly to as many as 700 largely uninsured tankers, to circumvent rules that deny high-quality insurance to ships carrying oil to be sold above $60 (£45) a barrel.",
      "The innovative US-designed oil cap policy balances two objectives – limiting Russian revenues for its war machine, while maintaining the supply of oil for the world economy.",
      "Ships that operate without insurance can be be placed under sanctions by G7 countries.",
      "Sign up to Headlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion Budrys said the paradox was that less than half of the ships under either EU, US or UK sanctions had been embargoed by all three.",
      "He said he wanted to see all ships in the fleet under sanctions, and for the level of proof required to sanction a ship to be reduced and standardised.",
      "Baltic states, he said, needed to clarify the unclear national protocols under the UN convention on the law of the sea (Unclos) about the right to inspect an unflagged ship, especially inside a country’s exclusive economic zone.",
      "Since last June, the Estonian transport agency has checked the documents of more than 450 ships, but the right to interdict in international waters is strictly limited.",
      "Budrys rejected the fears of some Baltic shipping companies that a more aggressive posture would lead to restrictions on freedom of navigation for western ships in the South China Sea.",
      "He said lawyers often advised ministers that the current law on interdiction was unclear, but he said there was no point trying to reopen the outdated Unclos itself, since the process would take too long.",
      "He said: “Last week’s events involving Russian protection of the Jaguar through the use of Russian jets changes the overall assessment and picture.",
      "Russia now is showing force, creating an incident and even entering Nato airspace to protect these vessels.” Since January, Nato’s Baltic Sentry mission has been established to protect the Baltic Sea’s critical infrastructure, principally undersea cables, but it has no direct responsibility over the shadow fleet.",
      "Budrys said: “We need not only to continue Baltic Sentry, but to expand its mission, because the increase in the shadow fleet increases the probability of military incidents in the Baltic Sea.",
      "This is serious.” But Benjamin Hilgenstock, the head of macroeconomic research at the Kyiv School of Economics, claims the oil price cap has proved unenforceable, partly since no means exists to check that oil has been traded at the declared price.",
