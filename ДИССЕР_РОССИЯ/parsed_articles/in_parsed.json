      "The European Union, along with the UK, has, however, ramped up sanctions on Russia in its 17th sanctions package, announced earlier this week Russia and Ukraine have no further direct negotiations scheduled, the Kremlin announced on Thursday, as the conflict between them, which is well into its third year, continues to rage on.",
      "“There is no concrete agreement about the next meetings,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.",
      "“They are yet to be agreed upon.” This announcement comes days after US President Donald Trump's latest attempt to mediate the conflict in a two-hour call with Russian president Vladimir Putin, followed by subsequent calls to Ukraine's Zelenskyy and NATO officials.",
      "However, the call failed to achieve its intended purpose, with Trump ultimately leaving direct conflict negotiations to the two nations itself, stating, nevertheless, that ceasefire negotiations would begin “immediately”, followed by a broader plan to end the conflict itself, giving way to trade.",
      "He had also offered to attend the Russia-Ukraine peace talks at Istanbul earlier this month if Putin agreed to do so as well, but neither showed up.",
      "ALSO READ | EU, UK announce new sanctions on Russia after Trump's phone call fails to bring about ceasefire These talks fell through too, with Zelenskyy—who had also tried to get Putin to attend in person—remarking that the mutually-agreed prisoner swap was “only real result”.",
      "The two nations have agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war (POWs): the largest exchange of this kind since February 2022.",
      "Peskov told Russian news agency Interfax that Moscow had provided Kyiv a list of prisoners it required in the swap.",
      "“We have not yet received a counter list from Kyiv.",
      "We are waiting.” Meanwhile, Moscow's defence ministry claimed to have shot down 105 of Kyiv's drones overnight—the second consecutive night of border tensions—including 35 over its capital region, as per an Associated Press report.",
      "Kyiv's air force also claims to have intercepted 128 drones from Moscow at around the same time.",
      "Russia’s Defense Ministry said that it had shot down 105 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 35 over the Moscow region.",

      "The latest sanctions, finalised three months ago, will run parallel to Russian delays in agreeing to ceasefire negotiations, which, according to Trump, would be taking place with Putin and Zelenskyy meeting face-to-face at the Vatican.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had also spoken of a further package of sanctions being prepared, with inputs from Zelenskyy.",

      "(Edited by Asavari Singh) The fact that the strikes were delivered almost simultaneously over a frontage of hundreds of kilometres—stretching from Muzaffarabad in PoK to Bahawalpur in Pakistani Punjab—within a short span of about 30 minutes, left both the Pakistani state and the terror groups stunned, with no time to react.",
      "Also, the fact that four target locations were in Pakistan, across the international border, and included the headquarters of terror groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke, was unimaginable for the Pakistani military, adding to the shock and awe.",

      "Firstly, the military objectives—which include ‘eliminating Hamas from the face of the Earth forever’—are deemed unrealistic and difficult to accomplish on the ground.",
      "Secondly, on several occasions, a lack of synergy and growing discontent between the military, intelligence, and political leadership has come to the fore, leading to confused decision-making and stretched timelines.",
      "Then there’s the Russia-Ukraine War, which broke out on 24 February 2022 after Russia launched ‘Special Military Operations’ against Ukraine.",
      "Despite initial claims that Russia would achieve its politico-military objectives in 20-30 days, the conflict continues even three years on with no immediate signs of resolution.",
      "Reason?",
      "Russia had three stated objectives: demilitarisation of Ukraine, denazification of Ukraine, and the declaration of independence of Russian-speaking areas, especially Donetsk and Luhansk.",
      "Although Russia has been dominant for the most part during these three years of conflict, the challenge has been to translate these objectives into clearly defined targets for the military to strike and capture.",
      "How does a military achieve the aim demilitarisation or denazification?",
      "Obviously, military support from Europe and the US has also contributed to the continuation of the conflict.",
      "When discussing long-drawn conflicts, the US-led war in Afghanistan cannot be left out.",
      "A war which began with targeting Al Qaeda bases to avenge the 9/11 terror attack soon morphed into a war against the Taliban, gradually moving into the space of political stabilisation and training Afghan military forces to defend themselves.",
      "Result?",
      "An unending campaign with no clearly defined objectives, which finally came to a close with the embarrassing overnight pullout of American forces in August 2021, leaving the Afghans at the mercy of the Taliban.",
      "Many other military campaigns ended a similar manner, like the war in Yemen, which went on for eight years, from March 2015 to March 2023, and still left the Houthis in charge.",
      "The bottom line is that most countries have found it easy to get into a military conflict, but have not been able to devise a successful and effective exit strategy.",
      "Lessons from Operation Sindoor Operation Sindoor avoided many of the pitfalls of other conflicts around the world.",
      "Clearly defined military objectives.",
      "The operation was launched to target the terrorist outfits behind the Pahalgam attack.",
      "In striking nine locations in Pakistan, the Indian armed forces were precise in converting the military objective into action.",
      "The subsequent strikes on air defence targets and air bases in Pakistan were also based on clearly defined directions to strike back in response, and harder than the Pakistani effort.",
      "At no point did the military objectives stretch to include other possibilities like extending this operation to resolve territorial issues in PoK or Pakistan by undertaking ground operations or using naval forces for active kinetic action.",
      "This was a very important factor in enabling an early ceasefire.",
      "Strong and decisive political directives.",
      "In a country where terror strikes such as the Parliament attack in 2001 or 26/11 in Mumbai went unanswered, the scale, might, and depth of Operation Sindoor was an astonishing signal of political intent.",
      "The precise directive given to the armed forces, and the freedom to convert that political intent into military action, was a key factor in bringing down heavy punishment on terror groups and military infrastructure in Pakistan.",
      "Synergy and ‘whole of nation’ approach.",
      "Operation Sindoor was a textbook example of synergy between the Army, Navy, Air Force, and even the Border Security Force and other security and intelligence agencies.",
      "Selection of targets, timely corroboration of intelligence by multiple sources, evacuation of citizens in Indian border areas to safer places, and vigilance to ensure that communal harmony within the country was not disturbed—all were conducted with great synergy and inter-agency coordination, leading to speedy achievement of military objectives with minimum losses.",
      "Selection and maintenance of aim (target).",
      "By carefully selecting the nine locations critical to terror infrastructure in Pakistan on 7 May, the air defence systems on 8 May, and thereafter the 11 air bases on 9 May, the Indian armed forces displayed exceptional focus in applying a very important principle of war: ‘selection and maintenance of aim’.",
      "This was also a major contributory factor in the early declaration of ceasefire.",

      "Right from the outset, India maintained a clear position that the objective was to target terror infrastructure, and that Pakistani military or civilian infrastructure was not a part of the war objectives.",

      "Keeping the operations below the nuclear threshold.",
      "India kept the threat of Pakistan using nuclear weapons in mind while planning and executing operations.",
      "By not targeting any civilian areas or key civilian or military infrastructure (except air bases, that too in response to Pakistani air raids), and by not launching ground incursions deep into Pakistani territory or a naval blockade, India did not let Pakistan play victim or find grounds to explore the use of nuclear weapons.",

      "Although he does not mention the terms upon which the negotiations were reached, citing that Moscow and Kyiv were to agree those among themselves, he adds that the Kremlin was even ready to begin large-scale trade with America as soon as the “bloodbath” was over, in a tone reminiscent of Washington's renewed interest in breaking the warring nations apart as soon as it obtained joint access to Ukraine's mineral wealth.",
      "Stating that the negotiations would be taking place at the Vatican, he explained that he next contacted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian PM Giorgia Meloni, recently elected German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, and Finnish President Alexander Stubb.",

      "After all the speculation about how Russian President Vladimir Putin would respond to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s offer to meet for peace talks in Istanbul, it isn’t surprising that Mr. Putin declined.",
      "Instead he sent a low-level delegation, headed by the ultraconservative former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky.",
      "Having repeatedly declared Mr. Zelensky’s government illegitimate, Mr. Putin would have made a huge concession—and appeared weak—if he had met with Mr. Zelensky.",
      "More important, a meeting between the two, which President Trump had suggested he might attend as well, wouldn’t have achieved much.",
      "Mr. Putin relishes being a wartime leader and is determined to continue the conflict until Ukraine is coerced into becoming a “friendly\" neighbor.",
      "In keeping with Mr. Trump’s stance that Russia isn’t the aggressor in the Ukraine war, a White House proposal to end the conflict, crafted last month, made major concessions to the Kremlin, legitimizing Russia’s occupation of Crimea and granting Russia all the territory it has gained since the war began.",
      "The plan also proposed a gradual lifting of the economic sanctions against Russia that were imposed in 2014, as well as a promise that Ukraine won’t join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.",
      "When Mr. Zelensky rejected the deal, Mr. Trump accused him of being “inflammatory\" and suggested that he—not Mr. Putin—was the problem.",
      "Mr. Trump began to change his tune after Russia’s deadly April 24 missile and drone attack on Kyiv, saying the strikes were unnecessary and “very bad timing.\"",
      "Then, following a meeting with Mr. Zelensky before the funeral of Pope Francis, Mr. Trump questioned Mr. Putin’s interest in a peace deal and raised the possibility of new sanctions against Russia.",
      "He also said Russia had stolen Crimea from Ukraine.",
      "The sudden signing of an economic partnership agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine, announced April 30, further suggested that Mr. Trump was shifting to a more favorable stance toward Ukraine as he grew frustrated with Russia’s response to peace proposals.",
      "Meanwhile, top officials in Mr. Putin’s government began talking tough.",
      "On April 24 the head of Russia’s security council, former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, addressed proposals for a Western peacekeeping contingent in Ukraine to monitor compliance with a future cease-fire.",
      "Stating that Russia had invaded Ukraine because of the threat of NATO military deployment in Russia’s “historical territory\" inside Ukraine, Mr. Shoigu said that the introduction of foreign troops in Ukraine could lead to a direct military conflict between Russia and NATO countries.",
      "In an interview with the Russian news agency TASS on April 29, Mr. Shoigu’s predecessor and Putin ally Nikolai Patrushev, now an adviser to the Russian president, claimed that NATO was conducting naval exercises with nuclear-armed submarines and working out scenarios for a “nuclear apocalypse\" with strikes on Russian bases that house nuclear weapons.",
      "In an April 28 interview Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov laid out Russia’s maximalist demands for peace negotiations that went well beyond those in the Trump proposal.",
      "Against this backdrop Mr. Putin made an offer for Ukrainian and Russian negotiators to meet directly in Istanbul, without accepting a proposal for a 30-day truce supported by Ukraine, the U.S. and the European members of NATO as a precondition for further peace talks.",
      "Mr. Trump jumped on Mr. Putin’s proposal, leaving the Europeans and Ukrainians at a loss.",
      "Mr. Zelensky took a gamble and not only agreed but said he would attend, putting Mr. Putin in a difficult position.",
      "The day before the talks began, Mr. Putin and his top security and defense team met with Mr. Medinsky to prepare for the negotiations.",
      "If these men were concerned that Mr. Putin’s absence would reinforce Mr. Trump’s doubts about their leader’s intentions for peace, they were probably reassured by Mr. Trump’s subsequent statement: “Nothing’s going to happen until Putin and I get together\"—suggesting that the two can still reach a peace deal without including Mr. Zelensky.",
      "Mr. Trump apparently doesn’t understand that Mr. Putin isn’t ready to end hostilities.",
      "He said on Fox News Friday that “Putin is tired of the war.\"",
      "But, as Russian commentator Maksim Katz pointed out on May 13, Mr. Putin seems to enjoy the conflict: “Putin blossoms whenever he talks about war.",
      "Instead of an aging dictator, he appears as a military leader, a character in some exciting movie that is playing in real time 3D right around him.\"",
      "Having rallied his people to support a patriotic struggle against Western enemies and fueled Russia’s economic growth with massive military spending, Mr. Putin wants Mr. Trump to cut off arms deliveries and crucial intelligence to Ukraine so that Russian troops can move beyond their snail’s-pace offensive and gain substantial swaths of Ukrainian territory.",
      "With this goal in mind, Mr. Putin is going along with the negotiations in the hope that Mr. Trump eventually will give up on a peace settlement and walk away from the conflict altogether.",
      "As expected, Friday’s talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations failed to make progress because the Russians put forth their usual maximalist demands.",
      "The next day Mr. Trump announced that he will be talking by phone with Mr. Putin on Monday, and plans to call Mr. Zelensky after.",
      "Mr. Trump should make clear to Mr. Putin that if Russia doesn’t agree to a 30-day cease-fire and back off from its demands, the U.S. will keep providing Ukraine with the military aid necessary to defend itself against Russian aggression.",

      "In a landmark move, the EU unlocks frozen Russian assets to arm Ukraine with Finnish munitions and more Ukraine is set to receive €90 million ($101.35 million) worth of ammunition from Finland, as per a press release from the Finnish Ministry of Defence on Monday.",
      "The ammunition will be sourced using Russian financial assets that had been frozen by the European Union just after Moscow began its special military operation in Kyiv, in February 2022.",
      "The ammunition will be of Finnish origin, for which the Russian-origin funds will be released via the European Peace Facility (EPF).",
      "The EU has estimated that $221.5 billion out of approximately $300 billion worth of frozen Russian assets are held in the 27-nation bloc, primarily in the form of government bonds that the Bank of Russia, the nation's central bank, had stored as reserves, a Reuters report said.",

      "I am very pleased with the outcome,” the Minister of Defence Antti Häkkänen explained, in the press release.",

      "Reiterating Finland's “strong and unwavering” support for Ukraine, Häkkänen explained that the EU-sourced munitions package would be accompanied by a Finnish support programme worth €660 million ($741.6 million) to support, and “forge closer links between the Finnish industry and Finland's support” for the embattled nation.",
      "“This is a great example of the Finnish defence industry’s abilities, and it shows that our investments into ammunition production capacity are paying off,” Häkkänen concluded.",

      "The first high-level talks between Russia and Ukraine since the early stages of Moscow’s 2022 attack have concluded with a stark reminder of the immense gulf separating the two nations, offering scant optimism for an imminent ceasefire.",
      "Despite promises of a major prisoner swap, the talks revealed a profound lack of common ground on the fundamental steps required to stop the ongoing conflict.",
      "Despite the palpable distance in their positions, a sliver of diplomatic possibility remains.",
      "Turkey, the host nation said that both Russia and Ukraine had agreed in principle to hold further negotiations.",
      "The statement offers a glimmer of hope for US President Donald Trump, who has called for a swift peace agreement.",
      "Peter Slezkine, senior fellow and director of the Russia program at the Stimson Center, described the talks as “substantial steps.” He said, “I do think that they are a very hopeful sign, because the two sides coming into direct contact is an important development.” However, the initial optimism generated by the meeting quickly faded upon closer examination of the stated positions.",
      "Ukraine, backed by the United States and other Western allies, has consistently called for a 30-day ceasefire without any preconditions to facilitate meaningful peace negotiations.",
      "In stark contrast, Russia, which currently occupies nearly a fifth of Ukrainian territory, displayed minimal inclination towards compromise.",
      "Moscow reiterated its maximalist demands, insisting on Ukraine’s withdrawal from and recognition of Russia’s claim over four Ukrainian regions – territories the Kremlin unilaterally annexed but does not fully control.",
      "The carefully worded statements released by both sides following the Istanbul talks did little to conceal the deep chasm that persists between them.",
      "A Ukrainian diplomatic source, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the discussions, revealed that Russia presented demands that were “detached from reality and go far beyond anything that was previously discussed.” These reportedly included ultimatums for Ukrainian forces to withdraw from sovereign Ukrainian land, alongside “other nonstarters and non-constructive conditions.” Adding a chilling perspective, the Kremlin’s chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, suggested that Russia was prepared to continue its military campaign for as long as necessary to achieve its objectives.",
      "Drawing a historical parallel to Russia’s protracted 18th-century war against Sweden, he argued that Kyiv’s resistance to Russia’s “peace demands” was only hastening its own demise.",
      "A senior Ukrainian government official with direct knowledge of the abortive 2022 peace talks with Russia expressed little surprise at the outcome in Istanbul, telling Reuters that it unfolded “entirely as expected.” The source offered a more pragmatic, if less hopeful, view: “‘Every journey begins with a single step.",
      "This is the beginning of the journey.",
      "Demands are always exaggerated at the start of any negotiations.",
      "That’s classic.’” The fragile outcome places renewed emphasis on President Trump’s role.",
      "Just before the talks, Trump abruptly shifted stance, saying he needed a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to achieve a breakthrough.",
      "This move temporarily undercut European efforts to pressure Washington into imposing tougher sanctions on Russia.",
      "Earlier in the week, leaders of four major European powers had visited Kyiv, warning Russia of fresh sanctions if it failed to agree to a 30-day ceasefire by May 12, a position supported by the US However, when Putin proposed talks instead of a ceasefire, Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on social media to accept the proposal immediately, without mentioning impending sanctions.",
      "Zelenskyy, wary of alienating the influential US President, publicly supported direct talks with Putin.",
      "The Kremlin’s response was to dispatch a delegation for the Istanbul talks that conspicuously excluded Putin himself, as well as any high-ranking ministers.",
      "Russian political analyst Vladimir Pastukhov wryly commented on the appointment of Medinsky, a figure from the failed 2022 talks, as delegation head, saying, “You don’t send undertakers to a wedding.” After the Istanbul talks, Trump and the leaders of the four European powers spoke again with Zelenskyy to discuss the way forward.",
      "Publicly, the Ukrainian team renewed calls for direct negotiations between Zelenskyy and Putin, arguing only the Russian president has the authority to resolve key issues.",
      "Speaking to Fox News, Trump expressed optimism about reaching an agreement but added that he would impose sanctions on Russia if no deal could be made.",
      "While the talks represent a diplomatic step forward, the entrenched positions and expansive Russian demands suggest that a genuine ceasefire remains elusive for now, raising questions over whether the negotiations mark the beginning of peace or merely a strategic ploy in a protracted conflict."

      "Zelenskyy said he is sending a team headed by his defense minister from the Turkish capital Ankara to Istanbul to meet a Russian delegation, even though Moscow's side doesn’t include “anyone who actually makes decisions.” The Ukrainian side would be headed by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and its aim is “to attempt at least the first steps toward de-escalation, the first steps toward ending the war — namely, a ceasefire,” he said.",

      "However, Vladimir Putin isn’t on the list of officials, indicating he will not be present for the meet.",
      "Talks have previously taken place in cities such as Moscow, Kyiv, Washington, and Riyadh, as well as across Europe.",
      "Now, attention is focused on Istanbul, where many hope progress might be made in ending Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now in its third year.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested restarting direct peace negotiations with Ukraine in the Turkish city.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on him to meet in person in Turkey.",
      "Zelenskyy said on Tuesday, “If Putin does not arrive and plays games, it is the final point that he does not want to end the war.\"",
      "The Ukrainian president is expected to meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara.",
      "He said he would head to Istanbul at a moment’s notice if Putin turns up.",
      "“If Putin does not arrive and plays games, it is the final point [showing] that he does not want to end the war.",

      "What can we expect from the talks?",
      "Could this meeting bring an end to the war?",
      "Which leaders will be there?",
      "We will also take a look at the situation on the ground as these talks unfold in Turkey.",
      "On Saturday, Zelenskyy hosted French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in a show of unity.",
      "They issued a coordinated call for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine starting Monday.",
      "The plan has received backing from the European Union and U.S. President Donald Trump, who had promised during his campaign to swiftly end the war that is now in its fourth year.",
      "The leaders pledged tougher sanctions on Russia if Putin did not accept the proposal.",
      "In remarks to the media early Sunday, however, Putin effectively rejected the offer and proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul instead “without preconditions.” He did not specify whether he envisioned the talks to involve Zelenskyy and himself personally, or with lower-level officials.",
      "Zelenskyy responded by insisting on a ceasefire, saying he will travel to Turkey — and challenged Putin to do the same: “I will be waiting for Putin in (Turkey) on Thursday.",
      "Personally.",
      "I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses.” Pressed by reporters on who will represent Russia in Istanbul, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to say, stressing that Putin had outlined Russia’s position clearly enough.",
      "Trump’s administration initiated separate talks with Russia and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia in March.",
      "But since then, the administration has indicated it might withdraw from the process if no tangible progress is made.",
      "Trump said Monday he was optimistic about the talks — a sharp contrast to a contentious Oval Office meeting with Zelenskyy on Feb. 28.",
      "There is “the potential for a good meeting” between Putin and Zelenskyy, Trump said in Washington.",
      "He added he was “thinking about flying over” after his visit to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates but later said Secretary of State Marco Rubio and others from the U.S. will go to Turkey for the talks.",
      "Podolyak on Tuesday told a YouTube broadcast by prominent Russian journalists in exile that the Ukrainian leader won’t be meeting any Russian officials in Istanbul other than Putin.",
      "He added that “there are always people” in Zelenskyy’s entourage who can “conduct certain negotiations at corresponding levels” with the Russians but questioned the point of a lower-level meeting.",
      "“Undoubtedly, only Putin can make the decision to continue the war or stop the war,” he said.",
      "Zelenskyy said Tuesday he will meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the capital Ankara, and wait there.",
      "If the Russian leader chooses Istanbul for the meeting, Zelenskyy said, then he and Erdogan will travel there.",
      "If Putin doesn’t show, European and U.S. leaders should follow through with additional sanctions against Russia, he added.",
      "The Kremlin billed Thursday’s talks as a “restarting” of peace negotiations in Istanbul in 2022, early on in the war, that quickly fell apart.",
      "Moscow had blamed Ukraine and the West for their alleged desire to continue fighting, while Kyiv said Russia’s demands amounted to an ultimatum rather than something the sides could mutually agree on.",
      "Zelenskyy has said the Russian delegation’s demands included Ukraine’s recognition of Russian control over the Donbas, an area in eastern Ukraine consisting of Donetsk and Luhansk regions; constitutional amendments to declare neutrality; a significant reduction of Ukraine’s armed forces; and the surrender of long-range weaponry.",
      "“There were never any negotiations; it was an ultimatum from a murderer,” he said in 2022.",
      "Putin accused Ukraine of derailing a peace deal that was basically agreed on and included clauses of Ukraine’s neutral and nonnuclear status and details on how much its army would be reduced.",
      "“The Kyiv authorities … just threw it all away.",
      "They turned it down,” Putin said in 2023.",
      "The Kremlin has said repeatedly “the Istanbul agreements” could serve as a basis for further peace talks.",
      "After Moscow illegally annexed the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in September 2022, Russian authorities started saying that Kyiv should also recognise “the reality on the ground.” Putin last year demanded that Ukraine cede the four regions, which it still does not fully control.",
      "He also wants Kyiv to recognise the Crimean Peninsula, also illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014, as Russian; Ukraine also must renounce its bid to join NATO and drastically reduce its army.",
      "He also demanded that the West lift sanctions imposed on Moscow after the invasion.",
      "Kyiv, in turn, refused to cede any land and wants robust security guarantees against future Russian aggression.",
      "Trump, who has engaged in a broad diplomatic effort to end the war since taking office, has said that Crimea, “will stay with Russia.” He has also said that Kyiv was unlikely to ever join Nato.",
      "Both sides are preparing a warm weather campaign on the battlefield, where a war of attrition has killed tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides along the roughly 1,000-kilometre (620-mile) front line.",
      "The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said Russia is “quickly replenishing front-line units with new recruits to maintain the battlefield initiative.” In 2024 and more recently, Russian troops have made slow but steady gains in several sections along the front.",
      "Putin said in March that Russian troops have “gained steam” and “are holding strategic initiative all along the line of contact.” Zelenskyy warned that Russia was delaying talks in preparation for bigger offensives.",
      "Last month, Moscow’s forces also declared that they fully reclaimed chunks of Russia’s Kursk region bordering Ukraine that Kyiv’s forces seized in a surprise incursion in August 2024.",
      "Kyiv denied the claim, but it has been steadily losing ground there as Moscow, aided by North Korean soldiers, worked to push them out and leave Ukraine without a key negotiating chip.",
      "Several attempts to establish at least a partial ceasefire have been unsuccessful.",
      "Russia effectively rejected a 30-day unconditional truce; the Kremlin instead declared two short, unilateral ceasefires for holidays in the last two months –– one for 30 hours at Easter and another for 72 hours to coincide with Russia’s World War II Victory Day celebrations.",
      "In both cases, Kyiv and Moscow accused each other of failing to halt the fighting.",
      "Russia and Ukraine also pledged in March to observe a 30-day halt to attacking energy infrastructure that was brokered by the Trump administration.",
      "Both sides repeatedly accused each other of massive violations until the measure expired.",
