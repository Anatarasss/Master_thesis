      "If President Donald Trump wants lasting peace in Ukraine, he needs to unleash secondary sanctions on the countries keeping Vladimir Putin’s bloody war going.",
      "Trump left Monday’s call with Putin in an optimistic mood, posting that the chat “went very well” and that “Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War.” Thing is, Putin’s readout of the call still signaled that he’ll accept nothing less than domination of Ukraine: That’s what he means when he declares the overriding need “to eliminate the root causes of this crisis.” In Vlad’s mind, the “root cause” of the war is Ukraine’s sovereignty, so “Russia is ready to work with Kyiv” toward peace only via Kyiv’s surrender.",
      "Trump’s going to need to a big stick to get Putin to meaningfully bend.",
      "Russia illegally invaded under the guise of “de-Nazifying” the country and saving Russian-speaking Ukrainians from “oppression” — grievances impossible to address because they’re baseless.",
      "In all negotiations so far, Putin has insisted on conditions that would leave Kyiv neutered and vulnerable: demilitarization, NATO membership off the table, letting Russia keep all the territory it’s occupying and then some.",
      "Vlad won’t back off those demands unless he has no other option.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has a solution primed and ready: A bill he introduced with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) to impose a crippling a 500% tariff on imported goods from countries that buy Russian oil, gas, uranium etc.",
      "That would slam China, which has kept Putin’s war machine chugging with those energy purchases and exporting hundreds of billions in products to Moscow, staving off catastrophic inflation and shortages.",
      "Without that lifeline, Russia’s already limping economy would go kaput.",
      "President Xi Jinping sees Putin as an ally in his war on the West, but will only suffer so much economic pain on behalf of Moscow.",
      "A call from him could force Vlad to face reality at the negotiating table.",
      "Graham has said that the secondary sanctions bill has enough bipartisan support to pass “if Russia does not embrace an honorable, just and enduring peace.” Putin is making it ever more clear he has no intention to do so.",
      "Trump should give the go-ahead to start making China’s bankrolling of Moscow’s bloodlust hurt.",

      "Trump spoke with Zelenskyy twice on Monday, according to Zelenskyy, once one-on-one, before Trump’s call with Putin, and again during a conference call with the Ukrainian and NATO leaders.",
      "“I reaffirmed to President Trump that Ukraine is ready for a full and unconditional ceasefire,” Zelenskyy tweeted.",
      "“If the Russians are not ready to stop the killings, there must be stronger sanctions,” he wrote.",
      "“Pressure on Russia will push it toward real peace — this is obvious to everyone around the world.” In a Monday interview with NBC News in Rome, where he was received by Pope Leo XIV, Vice President JD Vance said, “We talked about a couple of what I would call the president’s major peace initiatives with the pope.",
      "We talked a lot about what’s going on in Israel and Gaza.",
      "We talked a lot about the Russia-Ukraine situation.",
      "It’s hard to predict the future, but I do think that, not just the pope, but the entire Vatican, has expressed a desire to be, you know, really helpful, and to work together on facilitating, hopefully, a peace deal coming together.",
      "Can’t predict the future, but that was very meaningful, and I think will hopefully bear fruit for the country.” Meanwhile, Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said before the call that Russia “highly values” and is “grateful to the American side.” In a briefing with journalists, he said that if the U.S. can “help to achieve our goals through peaceful means, then this is indeed preferable.” Peskov was also asked about the chance of Trump and Putin meeting in person, a possibility the American president floated on Friday.",
      "“It will largely depend on what they themselves decide,” Peskov said.",
      "The meeting “needs to be worked out” by the two leaders in terms of dates and other details, he added.",
      "Ahead of the much anticipated Trump-Putin call, leaders from Britain, France, Germany and Italy said they spoke Sunday with Trump.",
      "The British government said in a statement that it was urging “Putin to take peace talks seriously.” Those leaders “also discussed the use of sanctions if Russia failed to engage seriously in a ceasefire and peace talks,” the statement said — something Trump has previously threatened.",
      "“Tomorrow, President Putin must show he wants peace by accepting the 30-day unconditional ceasefire proposed by President Trump and backed by Ukraine and Europe,” French President Emmanuel Macron said on X. Trump has been widely criticized for appearing to offer concessions to Russia while demanding sacrifices from Ukraine.",
      "Those voices were joined last week by former U.S.",
      "Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, who gave details of why she stepped down last month.",
      "“The policy since the beginning of the Trump administration has been to put pressure on the victim, Ukraine, rather than on the aggressor, Russia,” she wrote in an opinion piece Friday for the Detroit Free Press.",
      "“Peace at any price is not peace at all ― it is appeasement,” she said, adding that “we must show leadership in the face of aggression, not weakness or complicity.” While the diplomatic activity carries on, the violence in Ukraine continues.",
      "Russia has continued its near-nightly drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian civilians, more than three years after it launched a full-scale invasion and tried to seize Kyiv.",
      "On Sunday, Russia shelled residential neighborhoods of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kherson, killing a 75-year-old woman and injuring two other people, the city council posted on the Telegram messaging site.",
      "As well as being widely blamed for launching an unprovoked war, Russia is condemned across the West for the highly repressive and authoritarian state fashioned by Putin's Kremlin.",
      "On Monday, the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office labeled one of those critics, Amnesty International, as an \"undesirable organization\" and effectively banned it.",
      "The authority accused the London-based human rights watchdog of being \"Russophobic,\" trying to prolong the war, wanting to \"justify the crimes of Ukrainian neo-Nazis\" and its staffers of supporting \"extremist organizations.\"",
      "Trump, who has often spoken warmly of Putin, rarely if ever mentions these human rights concerns.",
      "Trump said in a Truth Social post on Saturday that he would be speaking with Putin at 10 a.m. Monday with the purpose of “stopping the ‘bloodbath’ that is killing, on average, more than 5,000 Russian and Ukrainian soldiers a week.” NBC News has not independently verified the numbers that Trump cited.",
      "Apparently referring both to his planned call with Putin and his slated talks with Zelenskyy and other European leaders, Trump added that “hopefully it will be a productive day, a ceasefire will take place, and this very violent war, a war that should have never happened, will end.” Despite promising on multiple occasions to end the war in 24 hours of taking office, Trump has since found the reality much different since beginning his second term.",
      "U.S.-brokered negotiations saw Russia and Ukrainian delegations meet in person in Istanbul last week for the first time since the early days of the war.",
      "However, the demands of the two sides remain far apart, with Russia saying it will only agree to a truce if Ukraine effectively surrenders.",
      "Ukraine has said these demands are unacceptable.",

      "WASHINGTON — Russian President Vladimir Putin doubled down Monday on not accepting a cease-fire in his 39-month-old war on Ukraine following a two-hour call with President Trump — saying that Moscow was not ready for peace until the “root cause” of the “crisis” is addressed.",
      "“Russia is ready to work with Kyiv on a memorandum on a future peace treaty which could include issues of a cease-fire and principles for resolving the conflict,” Putin said following the call, his first contact with Trump since Russian and Ukrainian negotiators agreed Friday to trade proposals to halt Europe’s bloodiest conflict since the Second World War.",
      "However, the 72-year-old added, there is a “need to work out the most effective paths toward peace” that would be suitable to “all sides.” The eventual peace agreement, Putin said, could “include a possible cease-fire for a certain period of time if appropriate agreements are reached.” Trump, 78, put a happy spin on the call, announcing on announcing on Truth Social that “[t]he tone and spirit of the conversation were excellent” and that “Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War.” The president’s statement notably stressed that Russia wants to resume major economic activity with the US — and made no mention of secondary sanctions, which Trump has previously mused about slapping on the Kremlin.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) is intending to introduce a widely-supported Senate bill that would put secondary sanctions on any country buying Russian oil, gas or natural gas, among other products.",
      "“Russia wants to do largescale TRADE with the United States when this catastrophic ‘bloodbath’ is over, and I agree,” Trump said.",
      "The 78-year-old added that he had relayed details of his talk with Putin to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, along with “Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, President Emmanuel Macron, of France, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, of Italy, Chancellor Friedrich Merz, of Germany, and President Alexander Stubb, of Finland.” “The Vatican, as represented by the Pope, has stated that it would be very interested in hosting the negotiations,” Trump concluded.",
      "“Let the process begin!” Trump later told reporters in the Oval Office that talks at the seat of the Roman Catholic Church “could help” some of the “anger” that exists between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "Zelensky, 47, stressed that Ukraine is ready for a “full and unconditional cease-fire” immediately, and that the world should pressure Russia to do the same.",
      "The Ukrainian leader revealed that Trump spoke to him first, then called Putin, and then had a shared call with the European leaders.",
      "“I reaffirmed to President Trump that Ukraine is ready for a full and unconditional ceasefire, as has spoken about, particularly the United States,” Zelensky wrote on X.",
      "“It is important not to dilute this proposal.",
      "If the Russians are not ready to stop the killings, there must be stronger sanctions.",
      "Pressure on Russia will push it toward real peace – this is obvious to everyone around the world.” Zelensky added that he would be ready to meet Putin in Turkey, Switzerland, the Vatican, or any other location, he said.",
      "“If Russia refuses to stop the killings, refuses to release prisoners of war and hostages, if Putin puts forward unrealistic demands, this will mean that Russia continues to drag out the war, and deserves that Europe, America, and the world act accordingly, including with further sanctions,” he argued.",
      "“Russia must end the war it started, and it can begin doing so any day.",
      "Ukraine has always been ready for peace.” Ukraine has said previously it would agree to a cease-fire immediately, while Putin has insisted that there are considerations that need to be discussed first — like halting more US aid to the war-torn country.",
      "“Putin is continuing to conflate the negotiations needed to reach a cease-fire agreement with those needed to reach a peace settlement in order to drive confusion in the West and falsely paint Ukraine as intransigent,” Kateryna Stepanenko, Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, told The Post.",
      "“By rejecting the full cease-fire that Ukraine and the US proposed, the Kremlin is laying the groundwork to make even more demands of Ukraine and the United States,”Stepanenko added.",
      "“A prolonged peace negotiation process without a cease-fire will allow Russia to continue its war effort in Ukraine, and the Kremlin may try to leverage the peace talks as a way to extract additional concessions beyond its original war aims.” Putin described the conversation with Trump as “frank and meaningful,” adding that he was thankful for the US president’s initiative to have direct talks with both belligerent leaders.",
      "Russia’s “position on the whole is known,” Putin added, a reference to his baseless claims in 2022 that Moscow was invading Ukraine to “de-Nazify” the country and save Russian-speaking residents of Ukraine from oppression by Kyiv.",
      "Ukrainian and Russian officials met face-to-face on Friday in Turkey for the first time in more than three years, opting to hold talks despite Putin declining to attend.",
      "The two sides agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war from each side and pledged to return to the negotiating table with cease-fire ideas.",
      "Earlier Monday, Vice President JD Vance told reporters on Air Force Two that the Trump administration wanted to see if Putin was “serious about negotiating peace” — and was “more than open to walking away” if he wasn’t.",
      "“The president has been very clear,” Vance said.",
      "“There’s a bit of an impasse here, and I think the president’s going to say to President Putin, ‘Look, are you serious, are you real about this?",
      "'” Without serious movement, the veep said, the Trump administration will describe the conflict as “Joe Biden’s war” — and will stop trying to mediate.",
      "“It’s not our war,” Vance said.",
      "“We’re going to try to end it, but if we can’t end it, we are eventually going to say, ‘That was worth a try, but we’re not doing it anymore.",
      "'” In the Oval Office Monday evening, Trump reiterated to reporters that “it’s not our war” and insisted that “I’ll just back away” if nothing happens.",
      "Trump added that he thought Putin wanted to end his invasion, saying: “I think he’s had enough.” “If I thought Putin did not want to get this over with, I wouldn’t even be talking about it, because I’d just pull out,” he added.",
      "Trump also said he has a red line in his head that would cause him to walk away, but wouldn’t reveal what it was.",
      "Going into Monday’s phone call, the Kremlin indicated that Putin also had a hard line from which he would negotiate.",
      "“The conversation is important, taking into account the negotiations held [Friday] in Istanbul,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters ahead of the conversation, per the Russian news agency TASS.",
      "“As for the talks, we have already said everything we could, we underscored the basic points.” Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova specifically said Putin was committed to the plan he proposed on June 14, 2024,.",
      "Those conditions included Ukraine withdrawing all troops from the eastern Donbas region, committing to never joining NATO, and remaining non-aligned and non-nuclear while allowing the Russian language to be taught in schools — as well as the lifting of all Western sanctions on Moscow.",

      "Watch CBS News Rome — Pope Leo XIV and Vice President JD Vance met at the Vatican on Monday ahead of a flurry of U.S.-led diplomatic efforts aimed at making progress on a ceasefire in Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "Vance, a Catholic convert, had led the U.S. delegation to the formal Mass opening the pontificate of the first American pope.",
      "Joining him at the meeting on Monday was Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also Catholic, Vance spokesperson Luke Schroeder said.",
      "\"There was an exchange of views on some current international issues, calling for respect for humanitarian law and international law in areas of conflict and for a negotiated solution between the parties involved,\" according to a Vatican statement after their meeting.",
      "There was also a customary exchange of gifts, with Vance presenting the Chicago-born pontiff a Bears jersey bearing the name \"Pope Leo\" and number \"XIV.\"",
      "The pope is also a White Sox fan, his brother confirmed earlier this month.",
      "Vance's office said he also gave the pope two books by St. Augustine, \"The City of God\" and \"On \"Christian Doctrine.\"",
      "The vice president's office noted that Vance chose St. Augustine as his patron saint when he converted to Catholicism and was baptized in 2019.",
      "Pope Leo had previously been head of the Augustinian order worldwide.",
      "The Vatican listed Vance's delegation as the first of several private audiences Leo was having Monday with people who had come to Rome for his inaugural Mass, including other Christian leaders and a group of faithful from his old diocese in Chiclayo, Peru.",
      "The Vatican, which was largely sidelined during the first three years of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has offered to host any peace talks while continuing humanitarian efforts to facilitate prisoner swaps and reunite Ukrainian children taken by Russia.",
      "After greeting Leo briefly at the end of Sunday's Mass, Vance spent the rest of the day in separate meetings, including with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "He also met with European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Italy's Premier Giorgia Meloni, who said she hoped the trialateral meeting could be a \"new beginning.\"",
      "In the evening, Meloni spoke by phone with President Trump and several other European leaders ahead of Mr. Trump's expected call with Russia's President Vladimir Putin on Monday, according to a statement from Meloni's office.",
      "Leo, the former Cardinal Robert Prevost, is a Chicago-born Augustinian missionary who spent the bulk of his ministry in Chiclayo, a commercial city of around 800,000 on Peru's northern Pacific coast.",
      "In the days since his May 8 election, Leo has vowed \"every effort\" to help bring peace to Ukraine.",
      "He also has emphasized his continuity with Pope Francis, who made caring for migrants and the poor a priority of his pontificate.",
      "Before his election, Prevost shared news articles on X that were critical of the Trump administration's plans for mass deportations of migrants.",
      "Vance was one of the last foreign officials to meet with Francis before the Argentine pope's April 21 death.",
      "The two had tangled over migration, with Francis publicly rebuking the Trump administration's deportation plan and correcting Vance's theological justification for it."

      "President Donald Trump is hoping separate phone calls Monday with Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will make progress toward a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine.",
      "Trump expressed his hopes for a “productive day” Monday — and a ceasefire — in a social media post over the weekend.",
      "His effort will also include calls to NATO leaders.",
      "Trump has struggled to end a war that began with Russia’s invasion in February 2022, and that makes these conversations a serious test of his reputation as a dealmaker after having claimed he would quickly settle the conflict once he was back in the White House, if not even before he took office.",
      "The Republican president is banking on the idea that his force of personality and personal history with Putin will be enough to break any impasse over a pause in the fighting.",
      "“His sensibilities are that he’s got to get on the phone with President Putin, and that is going to clear up some of the logjam and get us to the place that we need to get to,” said Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff.",
      "“I think it’s going to be a very successful call.” Still, there are fears that Trump has an affinity for Putin that could put Ukraine at a disadvantage with any agreements engineered by the US government.",
      "Bridget Brink said she resigned last month as the US ambassador to Ukraine “because the policy since the beginning of the administration was to put pressure on the victim Ukraine, rather than on the aggressor, Russia.” Brink said the sign that she needed to depart was an Oval Office meeting in February where Trump and his team openly berated Zelensky for not being sufficiently deferential to them.",
      "“I believe that peace at any price is not peace at all,” Brink said.",
      "“It’s appeasement and as we know from history, appeasement only leads to more war.” Trump’s frustration about the war had been building before his post Saturday on Truth Social about the coming calls, which he said would begin first with Putin at 10 a.m. Monday.",
      "Trump said his discussion with Putin would focus on stopping the “bloodbath” of the war.",
      "It also will cover trade, a sign that Trump might be seeking to use financial incentives to broker some kind of agreement after Russia’s invasion led to severe sanctions by the United States and its allies that have steadily eroded Moscow’s ability to grow.",
      "Trump’s hope, according to the post, is that “a war that should have never happened will end.” His treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Trump had made it clear that a failure by Putin to negotiate “in good faith” could lead to additional sanctions against Russia.",
      "Bessent suggested the sanctions that began during the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden were inadequate because they did not stop Russia’s oil revenues, due to concerns that doing so would increase US prices.",
      "The United States sought to cap Russia’s oil revenues while preserving the country’s petroleum exports to limit the damage from the inflation that the war produced.",
      "Putin recently rejected an offer by Zelensky to meet in-person in Turkey as an alternative to a 30-day ceasefire urged by Ukraine and its Western allies, including Washington.",
      "Those talks ended on Friday after less than two hours, without a ceasefire in place.",
      "Still, both countries committed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war each, with Ukraine’s intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, saying on Ukrainian television Saturday that the exchanges could happen as early as this week.",
      "While wrapping up his four-day trip to the Middle East, Trump said on Friday that Putin had not gone to Turkey because Trump himself wasn’t there.",
      "“He and I will meet, and I think we’ll solve it or maybe not,” Trump told reporters after boarding Air Force One.",
      "“At least we’ll know.",
      "And if we don’t solve it, it’ll be very interesting.” Zelensky met with Trump’s vice president, JD Vance, and top diplomat, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in Rome on Sunday, as well as European leaders, intensifying his efforts before the Monday calls.",
      "The Ukrainian president said on the social media site X that during his talks with the American officials, they discussed the negotiations in Turkey and that “the Russians sent a low level delegation of non-decision-makers.” He also said he stressed that Ukraine is engaged in ”real diplomacy” to have a ceasefire.",
      "“We have also touched upon the need for sanctions against Russia, bilateral trade, defense cooperation, battlefield situation and upcoming prisoners exchange,” Zelensky said.",
      "“Pressure is needed against Russia until they are eager to stop the war.” The German government said Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French, British and Italian leaders spoke with Trump late Sunday about the situation in Ukraine and his upcoming call with Putin.",
      "A brief statement gave no details of the conversation, but said the plan is for the exchange to be continued directly after the Trump-Putin call.",
      "In a post on X about the conversation, French President Emmanuel Macron said that Putin on Monday “must show he wants peace by accepting the 30-day unconditional ceasefire proposed by President Trump and backed by Ukraine and Europe.” The push came as the Kremlin launched its largest drone barrage against Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, firing a total of 273 exploding drones and decoys, Ukraine’s air force said Sunday.",
      "The attacks targeted the country’s Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions.",

      "Follow: For President Donald Trump, Monday’s phone call with Russian leader Vladimir Putin amounted to a major occasion — meant to ascertain his counterpart’s willingness to bring the conflict in Ukraine to an end.",
      "“I said when are we going to end this, Vladimir?” Trump recounted later to reporters.",
      "“I said when are we going to end this bloodshed, this bloodbath?” For Putin, it seemed to be a much less momentous event.",

      "Without any major progress toward an immediate ceasefire, Trump sought to emphasize what he described as an excellent “tone and spirit” shared with the Kremlin leader.",

      "“And if it doesn’t, I just back away and they’re going to have to keep going.” Yet Putin has only ramped up drone and missile attacks on Ukraine, including this weekend on its capital, Kyiv.",
      "Trump has previously criticized those assaults as counterproductive but made no mention of the latest attack as he recounted his call with Putin.",

      "Trump took office in January promising to bring a swift end to fighting in Ukraine, but soon encountered the deep and seemingly irreconcilable differences between the warring countries.",
      "Trump has turned to a combination of threats and inducements — most of them unfulfilled — to get Russia and Ukraine stop fighting.",
      "But both sides believe time is on their side.",
      "In his dealings with Trump, Putin has tried to appease the US president by appearing to negotiate peace, but without offering any meaningful concessions to Ukraine.",
      "Given his repeated claims that Russia has the means to obtain all its goals in the war, making concessions might risk making Putin look weak.",
      "On Monday, Vice President JD Vance questioned Putin’s position.",
      "“I’m not sure that Vladimir Putin has a strategy himself for how to unwind the war,” Vance told reporters on Air Force Two.",
      "“He’s got a million men under arms; he’s reengineered his entire economy.",
      "What used to be manufacturing facilities making products for people to use in their civilian life, they’re now making tank shells and artillery shells and drones.” The inherent contradictions of Putin’s strategy were on display over the weekend.",
      "In an apparent show of strength, Russia unleashed deadly drone strikes on civilian targets in Ukraine on Saturday and Sunday, even though Trump has criticized such attacks as counterproductive.",
      "On Saturday, Russian attacks killed at least 14 Ukrainian civilians.",
      "On Sunday, at least one civilian died after Russia targeted Kyiv, Ukraine, with one of the largest drone attacks of the war.",
      "Advertisement Trump has not commented on the latest attacks.",
      "In late April, however, he issued a rare rebuke of Putin for launching a similar attack.",
      "“I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV.",
      "Not necessary, and very bad timing,” Trump wrote.",
      "“Vladimir, STOP!” Trump said in his post on Truth Social that after speaking to Putin on Monday he subsequently spoke to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and his European allies.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain said in a statement that he spoke with leaders of the United States, Italy, France, and Germany on Sunday night to discuss forcing Russia to accept an unconditional cease-fire, and the use of new sanctions “if Russia failed to engage seriously.” Ukraine and its European allies have been demanding that Russia accept an unconditional 30-day cease-fire before beginning peace negotiations.",
      "Putin has demanded the opposite, saying that negotiations over what he calls the “root causes” of the war must take place before his forces, who are on the offensive in Ukraine, lay down arms.",
      "Trump in effect had sided with Putin.",
      "Last week he publicly told Zelensky to start talks with Russia, precipitating a series of events that led to the meeting in Istanbul.",
      "The Kremlin doubled down on its insistence for negotiations before any cease-fire, hours before the call Monday, tempering expectations of a breakthrough.",
      "“There’s meticulous and perhaps, in some areas, prolonged work ahead,” Peskov told reporters, referring to a diplomatic solution to the war.",
      "Vance suggested that Trump on Monday may offer Putin economic incentives to accept some concessions on Ukraine, and move the peace talks forward.",
      "Advertisement Trump also focused on trade after the call.",
      "“Russia wants to do largescale TRADE with the United States when this catastrophic ‘bloodbath’ is over, and I agree,” he wrote on Truth Social.",
      "“There is a tremendous opportunity for Russia to create massive amounts of jobs and wealth.",
      "Its potential is UNLIMITED.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times."

      "INDIANAPOLIS — A rookie driver for a brand new team won the pole for the Indianapolis 500 on a strange day at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where Team Penske was disqualified before the final two rounds of qualifying.",
      "Robert Shwartzman, a 25-year-old with dual nationality in Israel and Russia, became the first Indy 500 rookie to qualify on the pole since 1983 when he did it for Prema Racing with a four-lap average of 232.790 miles per hour.",
      "The last rookie to qualify on the Indy 500 pole was Teo Fabi.",
      "Coincidentally, he was an Italian — just like Prema, which also was founded in ’83.",
      "Prema is established in Europe and races in the Formula 2 series.",
      "It made its IndyCar debut this season.",
      "Shwartzman was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, and raised in Saint Petersburg, Russia.",
      "He began racing go-karts when he was 4 years old, and eventually, his budding career in motorsports took him to Italy and elsewhere in Europe.",
      "He initially raced under the Russian flag until the start of the war with Ukraine, when he changed to the Israeli, making him the first driver from Israel to make “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” He made an impassioned plea for peace in the Middle East, where Israel has been at war with Hamas-led Palestinian groups since 2023, and Eastern Europe, where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with top US officials Sunday ahead of a phone call Monday between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin aimed at ending their war.",
      "Advertisement “I just want peace in the world,” Shwartzman said.",
      "“I want people to be good, and I don’t want the separation of countries, saying, ‘This is bad country.",
      "This is good country.’ There is no bad or good.",
      "We’re all human beings, and we just have to support each other.",
      "We need to find ways to, let’s say, negotiate things.",
      "Find ways to agree on things, you know?",
      "Because from my experience, there is always, you know, a gold medal, I’m calling it — like, there’s always the right path.” Advertisement Prema is the first team making its debut in the Indy 500 to land on the pole since Mayer Motor Racing put Tom Sneva there in 1984.",
      "A post shared by Indianapolis Motor Speedway (@indianapolismotorspeedway) Shwartzman, who has never before raced on an oval, was mobbed by a sea of red-clad team members as soon as his pole-winning run became official.",
      "“Honestly it feels like I’m dreaming.",
      "I just had it in my dreams when I was going how would it feel to do such a good job in quali,” he said.",
      "“It’s the Indy 500.",
      "It’s the main race of the year.",
      "Honestly it feels unbelievable.” Shwartzman had been pursuing a career in Formula 1 and was part of the Ferrari development program, as well as its reserve driver from 2021 until the end of last season — when Prema nabbed him for its two-car team.",
      "He was the fourth of six drivers to make their qualifying attempt and took the pole from Takuma Sato of Rahal Letterman Lanigan.",
      "He still had to wait for Pato O’Ward of McLaren and Felix Rosenqvist of Meyer Shank Racing to make their runs, and he nervously watched from pit lane.",
      "O’Ward went first and landed in the third spot.",
      "Rosenqvist dropped to fifth, sandwiched in the second row between Chip Ganassi Racing teammates Scott Dixon and Alex Palou.",
      "It was a strange finishing order as the Ganassi cars were expected to battle each other for the top starting spot in next Sunday’s race.",
      "Advertisement “Rookie on pole with Shwartzman — how wild does that get?",
      "New team.",
      "I didn’t see that coming at all,” said 2008 winner Dixon.",
      "A post shared by NTT INDYCAR SERIES (@indycar) The pole was wide open for the taking first when Team Penske was disqualified from qualifying for an illegal modification on the cars of two-time defending Indy 500 winner Josef Newgarden and Will Power, and Scott McLaughlin destroyed his car in a Sunday morning crash during practice.",
      "The three Penske drivers all started on the front row last year, but will be 10th, 11th, and 12th in the fourth row together next weekend.",
      "That put the odds in Ganassi’s favor, but they had a surprising drop in speed from Saturday to Sunday.",
      "So then Sato, in his first race in nearly a year, sat atop the scoring pylon until Shwartzman’s shocking run.",
      "“I don’t even know what to say.",
      "The car felt amazing,” he said, ”Coming here for my first oval race, I couldn’t even expect to be in this position.",
      "Big thanks to everyone.",
      "Big thanks to the fans cheering for me.",
      "It’s unbelievable.” Shwartzman’s engineer is Eric Leichtle, who spent a season with Team Penske as the engineer for Newgarden in 2022.",
      "Leichtle left motorsports and spent the past two years working for SpaceX as a senior structures engineer."

      "Follow: Russia battered Ukraine over the weekend with its largest drone attack since the war began, Ukraine’s military said Sunday, ahea﻿d of an expected phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending hostilities.",
      "Russia launched 273 Shahed drones in one night, the Ukrainian Air Force said Sunday, predominantly targeting the central Kyiv region, where they killed a 28-year-old woman and wounded three others, including a 4-year-old child, according to the region’s governor.",
      "More strikes hit overnight, killing at least two people and injuring 13 others, local authorities said Monday.",
      "The Ukrainian Air Force said Russia launched a further 112 drones in the early hours of Monday, attacking the regions of Kharkiv, Sumy, Donetsk, Cherkasy and Kirovohrad.",
      "The barrages came as Trump said he would speak to Putin by phone on Monday, which the Kremlin has confirmed.",
      "The Russian leader has previously ignored a proposal from Washington and Kyiv for a 30-day ceasefire and last week snubbed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s call to meet face-to-face for talks in Istanbul.",
      "Trump has said he doesn’t think there will be a significant breakthrough on peace talks until he speaks with Putin.",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Russia is “grateful to the American side” for its mediation efforts, adding, “if they really help us achieve our goals by peaceful means, then this is indeed preferable.” The US president is growing frustrated with Putin, Finland’s President Alexander Stubb told local media on Sunday, after he spoke with Trump by phone the day before.",
      "“Zelensky is patient, but Trump is starting to grow impatient” toward Putin, Stubb told a press conference in Estonia.",
      "Meanwhile, Russian forces downed 75 Ukrainian drones over the weekend, state-run news agency TASS reported Sunday, citing Moscow’s defense ministry.",
      "These latest Russian aerial assaults come after a drone attack on a bus in Ukraine’s northeastern region of Sumy killed at least nine people and injured seven Saturday, just hours after the two countries met for the first direct peace talks since the early weeks of Russia’s 2022 invasion.",
      "The negotiations in Turkey failed to produce a major breakthrough.",
      "The two countries discussed a possible meeting between their presidents, a ceasefire and agreed a prisoner swap.",
      "The talks capped days of back-and-forth: Putin called for the face-to-face meeting but did not attend, instead sending a junior delegation after rejecting Ukraine’s proposal of a 30-day ceasefire.",
      "Related article A whiplash week of diplomacy leaves Ukraine much where it started During the talks, Russia demanded Ukraine cede land that was still under Kyiv’s control, a source familiar with Friday’s negotiations told CNN, a position Ukraine has long dismissed.",
      "The leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Poland called Russia’s stance in the talks “unacceptable.” In a TV interview with a Russian state media journalist released Sunday, Putin said he wanted to “eliminate” the causes of the conflict.",
      "The footage had a date banner reading March 27, but its release Sunday perhaps signals Moscow’s unchanged stance ahead of any future talks.",
      "Zelensky, for his part, said he had had a “good meeting” Sunday with US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Italy, where the trio discussed Friday’s peace talks.",
      "They also “touched on” Russian sanctions, the battlefield situation and future prisoner swaps, the Ukrainian president added in a post on social media.",

      "Watch CBS News Washington — Republican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said the U.S. government halted cyber operations against Russia for one day in February as President Trump was trying to negotiate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, confirming CBS News reporting at the time and undercutting statements of denial from the Defense Department.",
      "\"I actually dug into this whole matter.",
      "I just want to address it: It was a one-day pause, which is typical for negotiations,\" said Bacon, chair of the House Armed Services cyber subcommittee, during a hearing on Capitol Hill on Friday.",
      "\"That's just about as much as I can say.",
      "It was a one-day pause.\"",
      "In March, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had issued a directive to U.S. Cyber Command to pause cyber operations against Russia, including those that were the most provocative.",
      "At the time, the duration of the pause was unknown.",
      "In response to reports about the pause, the Pentagon's rapid response team posted on March 4 on X that Hegseth \"has neither canceled nor delayed any cyber operations directed against malicious Russian targets and there has been no stand-down order whatsoever from that priority.\"",
      "Two sources familiar with Hegseth's order said the pause directive lacked specificity.",
      "It's not clear how the order about planning was interpreted.",
      "Multiple officials also told CBS News in March that strategizing for future operations was never paused and that U.S. cyber policy on Russia \"is very much intact\" and remains at the same level, one of the officials said.",
      "Bacon's remarks are the first on-the-record acknowledgment of the directive's existence, which was first reported in February by The Record, a cybersecurity news publication.",
      "It's not uncommon for certain military operations to be paused during sensitive negotiations between countries.",
      "Both Democratic and Republican administrations have halted operations to prevent U.S. intentions from being misconstrued and to keep diplomacy on track.",
      "In addition to the Pentagon's statement on X, the Trump administration stonewalled inquiries on the matter and continued to deny any pause was ordered.",
      "A senior U.S. defense official at the Defense Department declined to answer questions from CBS News at the time when asked about the reported pause.",
      "In Friday's House hearing, the statement from DOD Rapid Response was called out by Army veteran and Democratic Rep. Eugene Vindman, who accused the Pentagon of lying about the pause directive.",
      "\"What I would like to do is basically point out that that statement by DOD Rapid Response was an outright lie,\" said the Virginia congressman.",
      "\"It was at least misleading.",
      "And that is not what the American people deserve, and that will be something that I intend to follow up with the secretary when he actually shows up.\"",
      "The Pentagon created the DOD Rapid Response account in February, and it is overseen by conservative podcaster and Army veteran Graham Allen, who is now the Pentagon's digital media director.",
      "The account commonly attacks news publications and posts comments criticizing reporting about Hegseth and the Defense Department.",
      "The X account has omitted context from its statements, touting an increase in U.S. military recruiting numbers between February 2024 through February 2025, even though much of the period showing improved recruitment numbers occurred during the Biden administration, as CBS News' Confirmed team found.",
      "Trump administration officials have promised to run \"the most transparent Defense Department in history,\" but to date, the Pentagon has held just one formal briefing.",
      "Instead of regular press engagements, the Pentagon's modus operandi for official Defense Department communications is often to bypass legacy news media outlets and attack their reporting.",

      "Watch CBS News Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates — President Trump said Friday that he's moving to set up direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin as soon as he can, after Putin opted to skip peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Turkey.",
      "\"I think it's time for us to just do it,\" Mr. Trump told reporters as he wrapped a four-day visit to the Middle East.",
      "Later, he told reporters on Air Force One, setting off on the journey back to Washington, that he might call Putin soon.",
      "\"He and I will meet, and I think we'll solve it or maybe not,\" Mr. Trump said.",

      "Meetings between Ukrainian and Russian delegations did get underway in Istanbul Friday, though Putin sent a lower-level delegation.",
      "This prompted accusations from Ukraine and its European partners that Moscow wasn't really interested in a negotiated resolution to the war.",
      "After the meetings concluded, Vladimir Medinsky, who led the Russian delegation, said in a statement that the two countries agreed that \"in the coming days,\" they'll hold a large-scale exchange of 1,000 prisoners of war for each side.",
      "He also said Russia has \"taken notice\" of Ukraine's request for direct talks between the heads of state, and that each side \"would present its vision of a possible future ceasefire.\"",
      "Once the detailed outlines are presented, negotiations will continue.",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to take part in the talks as Mr. Trump pressed for the leaders to find a solution to the war, ongoing since Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",

      "Mr. Trump has pressed both sides to quickly come to an agreement to end the war.",

      "By LLAZAR SEMINI and LORNE COOK, Associated Press TIRANA, Albania (AP) — European leaders have agreed with U.S. President Donald Trump that Russia’s position in ceasefire talks with Ukraine is unacceptable and they intend to coordinate a response, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Friday.",
      "Starmer spoke from Albania’s capital, Tirana, where leaders of dozens of European countries were gathered for the European Political Community, or EPC, summit attended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "“We just had a meeting with President Zelensky and then a phone call with President Trump to discuss the developments in the negotiations today, and the Russian position is clearly unacceptable,” Starmer told reporters.",
      "“As a result of that meeting with President Zelensky, under discussion with President Trump, we are now closely aligning and coordinating our responses and will continue to do so,” he said.",
      "He said that the decision with Trump was also agreed on with the leaders of France, Germany and Poland.",
      "Russia and Ukraine held their first first direct peace talks since the early weeks of Moscow’s full-scale invasion, which began on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "The latest Russia-Ukraine talks were held in Turkey on Friday, but they ended after less than two hours, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry and a Ukrainian official.",
      "Kyiv accused the Kremlin of introducing new “unacceptable demands” to withdraw Ukrainian forces from huge swaths of territory, according to the official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to make official statements.",
      "Earlier, Zelenskyy had said that Ukraine is committed to ending the war, but urged dozens of European leaders to ramp up sanctions if Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to play for time in talks aimed at securing a truce.",
      "“Ukraine is ready to take all realistic steps to end this war,” Zelenskyy told leaders at the European summit.",
      "But he warned: “If it turns out that the Russian delegation really is just theatrical and can’t deliver any results today, the world must respond.” That reaction, he said, should include “sanctions against Russia’s energy sector and banks.” Starmer backed his call, saying in a summit speech that “Russia is dragging its feet and playing games.” “We must be prepared to follow through because if Russia won’t come to the negotiating table, Putin must pay the price,” he said.",
      "Zelenskyy’s remarks came after Putin declined to attend face-to-face talks.",
      "“I think Putin made a mistake by sending a low-level delegation,” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said as he arrived for the summit under a steady drizzle.",
      "“The ball is clearly in his part of the field now, in his court.",
      "He has to play ball.",
      "He has to be serious about wanting peace.” European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that Putin was “playing games, which shows that they are not serious about peace.” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that it was clear that “President Zelenskyy was ready to meet but President Putin never showed up, and this shows his true belief.",
      "So we will increase the pressure.” Von der Leyen said that the EU is preparing a new package of sanctions.",
      "She said that the measures will target the shadow fleet of aging cargo vessels that Russia is using to bypass international sanctions and the Nord Stream pipeline consortium.",
      "Russia’s financial sector would also be targeted, she said.",
      "EU envoys have been working on the new sanctions package for several weeks, and the bloc’s foreign ministers could enact them as soon as Tuesday.",
      "Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni stressed that efforts to reach a deal on Ukraine must continue.",
      "“I think … that we must not throw in the towel.",
      "I think we must insist, we must insist for an unconditional ceasefire and a serious peace agreement that includes guarantees of security for Ukraine,” she said.",
      "The theme of the summit in Tirana was “New Europe in a new world: unity — cooperation — joint action.” The gathering of leaders from about 50 nations and organizations was also addressing ways to improve the continent’s competitiveness and tackle unauthorized migration.",
      "But the summit best serves as a setting for leaders to meet bilaterally, or in small groups, to weigh in on major security issues.",
      "The inaugural summit in Prague in 2022 saw the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia holding rare talks in an effort to ease tensions between the longtime adversaries.",
      "The last summit, hosted by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, an ardent supporter of Trump, was dominated by the concerns and opportunities that might arise in the wake of Trump’s reelection.",
      "The leaders arrived in Tirana’s central Skanderbeg Square on a rainy morning and were greeted by a brief performance by dancers in folk costumes before heading into the temporary conference hall, set up at the foot of a monument to Albania’s national hero Gjergj Kastrioti Skenderbeu, or Skanderbeg, who fought against the Ottoman Empire.",
      "The summit comes after the governing Socialist Party of the host, Prime Minister Edi Rama, won Albania’s May 11 parliamentary election, attracting voters who support the country’s long and somewhat uphill effort to join the EU.",
      "The vote secured a fourth term for Rama.",
      "The prime minister said that the summit is a point of pride for Albania, and an “inspiration and motivation to continue further on.” His Socialist Party says it can deliver EU membership in five years.",
      "The EPC forum is Macron’s brainchild, and was backed by former German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, aiming to boost security and prosperity across the continent.",
      "But critics claimed it was an attempt by them to put the brakes on EU enlargement.",
      "The 2022 inaugural summit involved the EU’s 27 member countries, aspiring partners in the Balkans and Eastern Europe, as well as neighbors like the U.K. — the only country to have left the EU — and Turkey.",
      "Russia is the one major European power not invited, along with Belarus, its neighbor and supporter in the war with Ukraine.",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he discussed the results of the talks with U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of France, Germany, the U.K. and Poland.",
      "In a post on X from a European leadership meeting in Albania, he urged “tough sanctions” against Moscow if it rejects “a full and unconditional ceasefire and an end to killings.” At the brief Istanbul talks, Kyiv and Moscow agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war each, according to the heads of both delegations, in what would be their biggest such swap.",
      "Both sides also discussed a ceasefire and a meeting between their heads of state, according to chief Ukrainian delegate, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov.",
      "Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, who headed Moscow’s delegation, said both sides agreed to provide each other with detailed ceasefire proposals and Ukraine requested the heads of state meeting, which Russia took under consideration.",
      "During the talks, a senior Ukrainian official said Russia introduced new, “unacceptable demands” to withdraw Ukrainian forces from huge swaths of territory.",
      "The official, who was not authorized to make official statements, spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.",
      "The proposal had not been previously discussed, the official said.",
      "The Ukrainian side reiterated it remained focused on achieving real progress — an immediate ceasefire and a pathway to substantive diplomacy — “just like the U.S., European partners, and other countries proposed,” the official added.",
      "The two sides sat opposite each other at a U-shaped table in the Dolmabahce Palace but remained far apart in their conditions for ending the war.",
      "Trump, who has pressed both Moscow and Kyiv for an end to the conflict, said a meeting between himself and Russian President Vladimir Putin would happen “as soon as we can set it up.” “I think it’s time for us to just do it,” Trump told reporters in Abu Dhabi as he wrapped up a trip to the Middle East.",
      "Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan opened the talks by urging the delegates “to take advantage of this opportunity,” adding that it was “critically important that the ceasefire happens as soon as possible.” In a social media post afterward, Fidan described the POW swap as a “confidence-building measure” and said the parties had agreed in principle to meet again.",
      "Zelenskyy was in Tirana, Albania, with leaders of 47 European countries to discuss security, defense and democratic standards against the backdrop of the war.",
      "He met with French President Immanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.",
      "“Pressure on Russia must be maintained until Russia is ready to end the war,” Zelenskyy said on X, posting a photo of five leaders during the call, the second for the group since May 10.",
      "Both countries engaged in diplomatic maneuvering this week as they tried to show Trump that they are eager to negotiate, although he has expressed frustration over the slow progress and threatened to punish foot-dragging.",
      "On Thursday, Putin spurned an offer by Zelenskyy to meet face-to-face in Turkey.",
      "Zelenskyy accused Moscow of not making a serious effort to end the war by sending a low-level delegation.",

      "Commenting on a possible Trump-Putin meeting, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov appeared to indicate that momentum for such a summit is building.",

      "Russian forces, meanwhile, are preparing a fresh military offensive, Ukrainian government and Western military analysts say.",
      "A Friday morning drone attack on the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kupiansk killed a 55-year-old woman and wounded four men, said Oleh Syniehubov, head of the Kharkiv Regional Military Administration.. Russia’s invasion has killed more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians, the U.N. says, and razed towns and villages.",

      "“The enemy is trying to constantly escalate the situation.” But he told AP that many of his comrades “believe that by the end of the year there will be peace, albeit an unstable one, but peace.” Before the talks, Ukrainian officials met with national security advisers from the U.S., France, Germany and the U.K. to coordinate positions, the senior Ukrainian official told AP.",

      "Follow: Russia and Ukraine’s first direct talks in three years began Friday with hopes as dim as the gray Istanbul skies.",
      "And while the weather brightened as the talks went on, the prospects for peace did not.",
      "In the end a large prisoner swap (one of many in this war) and two discussion topics for future talks – a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, and the contours of a ceasefire – were the only deliverables, as the press pack at Istanbul’s Dolmabahçe Palace thinned out and the sun sank over the Bosphorus.",
      "The issue of a ceasefire is where the intractable differences are clearest.",
      "Russia, by proposing these talks last weekend, had managed to sidestep an ultimatum from Ukraine and its allies to sign up to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire or face major new sanctions.",
      "Ukraine, meanwhile, was “ready to have a ceasefire agreed today,” Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesman, Heorhii Tykhyi, told reporters in a hastily arranged briefing late Friday afternoon, suggesting this wasn’t achievable because Russia’s low-level delegation “probably has (a) limited mandate.” Yet that is not the only obstacle.",
      "Russia’s delegation made clear Friday, a Turkish official told CNN, that an unconditional ceasefire was not on the table, and if Ukraine wanted the guns to fall silent it would have to withdraw from territory Russia does not yet occupy in the four regions (Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson) that Russia attempted to illegally annex in 2022.",
      "Not a new demand, but one which is both unacceptable to Kyiv and led US Vice President JD Vance to state earlier this month that Russia was “asking for too much” in its requirements to end the war.",
      "As the diplomatic cars slipped through Istanbul’s crowded streets, US frustration seemed to mount.",
      "After US officials met with both sides soon before their direct talks, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio left Istanbul with a scathing assessment of their prospects.",
      "“We came because we were told that there might be a direct engagement between the Russians and the Ukrainians; that was originally the plan,” he told reporters.",
      "“That was not to be the case, or, if it is, it’s not at the levels we had hoped it would be at.” Related live-story Ukraine’s allies call Russian demands unacceptable after first talks in years And so, the Ukrainian side moved quickly to control the narrative.",
      "Barely had the delegations emerged in Istanbul before Zelensky, at a summit in Albania, convened a call with US President Donald Trump and key European allies.",
      "“Ukraine is ready to take the fastest possible steps to bring real peace,” Zelensky wrote on social media after the call.",
      "But he also made it clear that it was not just Ukraine that must act, adding “if the Russians reject a full and unconditional ceasefire and an end to killings, tough sanctions must follow.” Ukrainian officials in Istanbul took a similar tone.",
      "“The tentative success of today’s negotiations is still to be consolidated,” First Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya told reporters later in the afternoon.",
      "“That means that the pressure on the Russian Federation must continue.” There was also a clear effort to emphasize the positives.",
      "“If we managed to agree on 1,000 for 1,000 exchange we think this was already worth it” said Tykhyi, the foreign ministry spokesman, referring to an agreed prisoner swap.",
      "“This is a great achievement by the Ukrainian delegation.” Yet in a week where Russia has again rejected a ceasefire, ignored calls to send top-level officials to talks, and come to the table with demands that the US has already deemed unacceptable, there is still no sign of increased pressure from the US.",
      "Instead, Trump promised Friday to meet with Putin “as soon as we can set it up,” having previously claimed “nothing’s going to happen (on Ukraine) until Putin and I get together.” And so, the official Russian assessment from its chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, kept it simple.",
      "“We are satisfied with the outcome and ready to continue our contacts.”"

      "The subsequent intensification of the war and emerging evidence of alleged Russian war crimes -- as well as suspicions of sabotage operations against peace talks participants -- fatally undermined those early peace efforts.",
      "Later, Istanbul was also the hub of the Black Sea Grain Initiative that ran from 2022 to 2023, which with the support of Turkey and the United Nations temporarily allowed for the safe export of grain and other agricultural goods from Ukrainian and Russian ports through the Black Sea -- which had by then become a key theater of the fighting -- to the rest of the world.",

      "Moscow's 2022 full-scale invasion was a continuation of that initial cross-border aggression, with Russian columns surging out of occupied Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk to seize more territory.",

      "Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said that a Russian fighter jet entered NATO airspace in recent days after Estonia’s navy had intercepted a suspected shadow fleet ship in its waters.",
      "Recommended Videos Tsahkna said the navy stopped the ship, the Jaguar, because it was flying no flag and apparently had no insurance.",

      "“We need to understand that Russia has officially tied and connected itself to the Russian shadow fleet,” Tsahkna said, and underlined the importance of air patrols over the Baltic Sea, saying that “we need to understand that the situation is really serious.” The shadow fleet is made up of aging tankers bought used, often by nontransparent entities with addresses in non-sanctioning countries such as the United Arab Emirates or the Marshall Islands, and flagged in places like Gabon or the Cook Islands.",
      "Some of the vessels are owned by the Russian state Sovcomflot shipping company.",
      "Their role is to help Russia’s oil exporters avoid the $60 per barrel price cap imposed by Ukraine’s allies.",

      "ISTANBUL — High-stakes peace talks Thursday between Russia and Ukraine that were called for by Vladimir Putin hit speed bumps as the Kremlin confirmed he would be skipping the negotiations and President Donald Trump added that \"nothing\" would happen unless he and his Russian counterpart attended.",
      "Uncertainty over the start date, location and whether either side would even participate made for chaotic scenes in the Turkish capital, Ankara, as well as in Antalya and Istanbul — where some 200 journalists and crew were massed outside the Ottoman-era Dolmabahçe Palace with no clear idea of when talks would get underway.",
      "The talks were later postponed for Friday.",
      "The build-up to Thursday's talks had included a back and forth between Kyiv, Moscow and the Trump administration which hinted at the possibility of a three-way meeting involving Trump, Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "That did not ultimately materialize.",
      "While speaking to reporters on Air Force One en route to the United Arab Emirates, Trump was asked about the level of the delegation Russia sent to Turkey.",
      "“Look, nothing’s going to happen until Putin and I get together, OK?” he said, adding that Putin did not lead the delegation because Trump had chosen not to attend.",
      "“He wasn’t going if I wasn’t there.” Later on Thursday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that he would meet with the Ukrainian delegation in Istanbul on Friday.",
      "Echoing Trump's comments, he reaffirmed that the involvement of both Trump and Putin would be \"the only way we're going to have a breakthrough\" in the war.",
      "Rubio said the U.S. will decide on a timeline for a possible meeting between Trump and Putin after the Friday talks, adding that the president is willing to “stick with” the process as long as it takes to achieve peace.",
      "Prior to Rubio's comments, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had told CNN “no,” when asked whether Putin would be attending talks in Turkey, and had separately said at the time that there were “no preparations” for talks between Putin and Trump in the coming days.",
      "Putin made the suggestion for negotiations “without any preconditions” after Ukrainian allies, including Germany, France and Britain presented an ultimatum to Moscow to either accept the ceasefire proposal or face additional sanctions.",
      "The Russian leader's no-show is expected to further antagonize the White House, which has markedly changed its tone over the war in the past weeks.",
      "After his historic Oval Office shouting match with Zelenskyy, Vice President JD Vance has shifted to accusing Moscow of “asking for too much” in the bilateral peace talks senior Trump administration officials have held with Russia in recent weeks.",
      "That is partly because Trump’s major gripe with Ukraine — that American taxpayers have mostly funded its defense — was soothed after the two nations struck a minerals deal that would go some way to repaying American military aid.",
      "Zelenskyy has also presented himself as compliant, backing Trump’s calls for an immediate 30-day ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia.",
      "Trump has said he is “always considering” additional sanctions against Russia if he believes Moscow is blocking the peace process, with officials also suggesting secondary sanctions on the buyers of Russian oil.",
      "After heeding Trump’s calls to accept Putin’s initial suggestion of talks Sunday, Zelenskyy landed Thursday in Ankara.",
      "Before a planned meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Zelenskyy said he would meet with a broader Turkish delegation, as well as American diplomats.",
      "“The level of the Russian delegation is not officially known to me yet, but from what we see — it looks like not a serious level,” Zelenskyy said, using a Ukrainian word meaning \"sham\" or \"theatrical.\"",
      "“We must understand the level of the Russian delegation and what mandate they have — whether they are even capable of making any decisions on their own,” he added, “because we all know who actually makes decisions in Russia.” That was instead of joining the talks initially planned for Istanbul, after the Kremlin indicated late Wednesday that rather than Putin, or even Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, it was instead sending a relatively junior team headed by Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky and Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin.",
      "While the Kremlin's last-minute naming of a junior team has done little to dispel Ukrainian and European allegations that Putin is not taking Trump's peace-brokering attempts seriously, the Russian delegation that arrived Thursday in Istanbul was “ready for serious work,” the Russian Foreign Ministry's Maria Zakharova said at a news briefing the same day.",
      "Ukraine responded to the scaling-down of the talks by vascillating over whether it would even send a delegation to Istanbul, as Kyiv and Moscow appeared to disagree over the start time of talks.",
      "While Russian media initially reported a 10 a.m. local time start (3 a.m.",
      "ET) at the Dolmabahçe Palace, that shifted to midday and then after 5 p.m, before being postponed to Friday.",
      "Further illustrating the confusion in Istanbul, American personnel were seen late Thursday morning still appearing to prepare a venue for a U.S. delegation to use as a base, with officials huddled in urgent meetings and two security staff arriving with a German shepherd dog.",

      "It is unclear if she is being moved from the ICE facility.",
      "Petrova had been vacationing in France, where she stopped at a lab specializing in splicing superfine sections of frog embryos and obtained a package of samples to be used for research.",
      "As she passed through a U.S. Customs and Border Protection checkpoint in Boston Logan International Airport, Petrova was questioned about the samples.",
      "Petrova told The Associated Press in an interview last month that she didn't realize the items needed to be declared and was not trying to sneak in anything.",
      "After an interrogation, Petrova was told her visa was being cancelled.",

      "Petrova's boss and mentor, Leon Peshkin, said in an interview last month that the samples were not in any way dangerous or biohazardous.",
      "\"I don't think she did anything wrong,\" Peshkin told the AP.",

      "All rights reserved NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte attends a news conference at a NATO's informal meeting of foreign ministers in Antalya, southern Turkey, Thursday, May 15, 2025.",
      "(AP Photo/Khalil Hamra) ANTALYA – NATO foreign ministers on Thursday debated an American demand to massively ramp up defense investment as the United States focuses on security challenges outside of Europe.",
      "At talks in Antalya, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said more investment and military equipment are needed to deal with threats posed by Russia and terrorism but also by China, which has become the focus of U.S. concern.",
      "Recommended Videos “When it comes to the core defense spending, we need to do much, much more,” Rutte told reporters.",
      "He underlined that once Russia's war in Ukraine is over, Moscow could reconstitute its armed forces within three years to five years.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said “the alliance is only as strong as its weakest link.” He insisted that the U.S. demand for allies to invest 5% of their gross domestic product on defense over the next seven years is about “spending money on the capabilities that are needed for the threats of the 21st century.” The debate on defense spending is heating up before the summit of President Donald Trump and his NATO counterparts in the Netherlands on June 24-25.",
      "That gathering will set the course for future European security, including that of Ukraine.",
      "Further to that, Russian and Ukrainian delegations plan to hold their first direct peace talks in three years in Istanbul, even as Russian President Vladimir Putin spurned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s offer to meet face to face.",
      "Rubio said he would confer Friday in Istanbul with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and the Ukrainian delegation.",
      "He said the Russian delegation would be meeting with other members of the U.S. team and he hoped all the sides could come together.",
      "In other diplomacy, Rubio met with Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani on the sidelines of the NATO meeting, underscoring support for lifting U.S. sanctions and welcoming Syria's “calls for peace with Israel,” the State Department said.",
      "NATO members consider defense spending plan The NATO sessions focused on a new spending plan in the works.",
      "As Russia’s war on Ukraine entered its second year, NATO leaders agreed in 2023 to spend at least 2% of gross domestic product on national defense budgets.",
      "So far, 22 of the 32 member countries have done so.",
      "The new plan is for all allies to aim for 3.5% of GDP on their defense budgets by 2032, plus an extra 1.5% on potentially defense-related things like infrastructure — roads, bridges, airports and seaports.",
      "While the two figures add up to 5%, factoring in infrastructure and cybersecurity would change the basis on which NATO traditionally calculates defense spending.",
      "The seven-year time frame is also short by the alliance’s usual standards.",
      "Rutte refused to confirm the numbers but acknowledged the importance of including infrastructure.",
      "It’s difficult to see how many members would reach a new 3.5% goal.",
      "Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Italy, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain are not even spending 2% yet, though Spain expects to reach that goal this year, a year past the deadline.",
      "The U.S. demand would require investment at an unprecedented scale.",
      "But Trump has cast doubt over whether the U.S. would defend allies that spend too little — an incentive to do more, even as European allies realize that they must match the threat posed by Russia.",
      "A push for Europe to ensure its security Europe-wide, industry leaders and experts have pointed out challenges the continent must overcome to be a truly self-sufficient military power, chiefly its decades-long reliance on the U.S. as well as its fragmented defense industry.",
      "“There is a lot at stake for us,” Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kęstutis Budrys said.",
      "He urged NATO partners to meet the investment goals faster than the 2032 target \"because we see the tempo and the speed, how Russia generates its forces now as we speak.” British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said his country should reach 2.5% by 2027, and then 3% by the next U.K. elections planned for 2029.",
      "“It’s hugely important that we recommit to Europe’s defense and that we step up alongside our U.S. partners in this challenging geopolitical moment where there are so many precious across the world, and particularly in the Indo-Pacific,” he said.",
      "As an organization, NATO plays no direct security role in Asia, and it's unclear what demands the Trump administration might make of the allies as it turns its attention to China.",
      "The last NATO security operation outside the Euro-Atlantic area, its 18-year stay in Afghanistan, ended in chaos.",
      "Asked whether the next summit communique will underline that Russia still poses the greatest threat to NATO allies, Rutte said, \"We will see what is the best way to play that.” Questions also hang over the way the leaders will frame NATO's commitment to Ukraine.",
      "The war has dominated recent summits, with envoys struggling to find language that would further anchor the country to the alliance without actually allowing it to join.",
      "But this year, Washington has taken Ukraine's membership off the table.",
      "Trump has shown impatience with Zelenskyy and remains unclear whether the Ukrainian leader will be invited to the June meeting in The Hague.",

      "Despite huge efforts to tackle wildfire outbreaks in the region, which borders Mongolia, 49 forest fires continue to burn, with a total area exceeding 629,000 hectares, the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations said Wednesday.",
      "Since the beginning of this year, more than 1.4 million hectares of land have been affected by wildfires, according to figures from Russia’s Federal Agency for Forestry published on Tuesday, about three times the total area affected by fires in the United States and Canada so far this year combined.",
