We are waiting.‚Äù\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow's defence ministry claimed to have shot down 105 of Kyiv's drones overnight‚Äîthe second consecutive night of border tensions‚Äîincluding 35 over its capital region, as per an Associated Press report. Kyiv's air force also claims to have intercepted 128 drones from Moscow at around the same time.\n\nRussia‚Äôs Defense Ministry said that it had shot down 105 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 35 over the Moscow region. It was the second straight night that Kyiv‚Äôs forces have targeted the Russian capital.\n\nThe European Union, along with the UK, has, however, ramped up sanctions on Russia in its 17th sanctions package, announced earlier this week.\n\nThe latest sanctions, finalised three months ago, will run parallel to Russian delays in agreeing to ceasefire negotiations, which, according to Trump, would be taking place with Putin and Zelenskyy meeting face-to-face at the Vatican.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had also spoken of a further package of sanctions being prepared, with inputs from Zelenskyy."

But after the phone call with Trump on Monday, Putin said that efforts were ‚Äúgenerally on the right track‚Äù.\n\nIn a statement to media near the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Putin said ‚ÄúWe have agreed with the president of the United States that Russia will propose and is ready to work with the Ukrainian side on a memorandum on a possible future peace accord,‚Äù Reuters reported.\n\n‚ö°Ô∏è President of Russia Vladimir Putin‚Äôs statement to the press following his phone conversation with @realDonaldTrump üí¨ Russia supports a peaceful settlement of the Ukraine crisis.

The main thing for us is to eliminate the root causes of this crisis. We just need to determine the most effective ways to move towards peace,‚Äù Putin further added.\n\nAfter holding a two hour long call with Putin, US President Trump said Russia and Ukraine would begin negotiations for a ceasefire immediately. In a Truth Social post, Trump said the conversation with the Russian counterpart ‚Äúwent very well‚Äù and that talks for an immediate ceasefire and to end the three year long war would now begin. The US president further informed that he also held talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nPutin, who envisions the war with Ukraine as a watershed moment in Russia‚Äôs relation to the West, believes that the latter humiliated Moscow when the Soviet Union fell in 1991 and by enlarging NATO, the US-led alliance is encroaching on what Putin considers Moscow‚Äôs sphere of influence, including Ukraine.\n\nAccording to a Reuters report, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said that Putin and Trump didn‚Äôt discuss any specific timeline for the ceasefire proposal with Ukraine. But the two leaders discussed a possible prisoner swap, where it was proposed to trade nine Russians for nine Americans. The Kremlin aide added that Trump called the prospects for ties between Moscow and Washington ‚Äúimpressive.‚Äù"

Expressing concern over people being killed in the war, he said 5,000 young soldiers are being killed every single week on average and it's a number probably worse than that, in addition to other people who are being killed in towns.\n\nCalling it an absolute bloodbath, he said he has seen satellite pictures that are so bad, so horrible.\n\n‚ÄúMy little conversation with a nice gentleman named Vladimir Putin. We had a good talk, and I think that progress is being made. 5,000 young soldiers are being killed every single week on average.

However, it was not clear when or where any talks might take place or who would participate.\n\nTrump's announcement came days after the first direct engagement between Russian and Ukrainian delegations since 2022. Those negotiations on Friday in Turkey brought about a limited exchange of prisoners but no pause in the fighting.\n\nAhead of the calls, the White House said Trump had grown \"frustrated\" with both leaders over the continuing war.\n\nVice President JD Vance said Trump would press Russian President Vladimir Putin to see if he was truly interested in stopping the fighting, and if not, that the US could disengage from trying to stop the conflict.\n\nTrump later told reporters that he believed Putin was serious about wanting peace. \"The conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of,\" Trump said in a social media post."

He said Ukraine would also benefit from trade ‚Äúin the process of rebuilding its country.‚Äù\n\nEarlier on Monday, Putin said Russia is ready to work with Ukraine on a memorandum for a possible peace deal.

He believes picking up the phone can break the logjam, Witkoff said. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs going to be a very successful call.‚Äù\n\nYet, concerns persist. Critics warn that Trump‚Äôs perceived affinity for Putin could undercut Ukraine. Former US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, who resigned last month, criticised the administration‚Äôs approach. The pressure was always on the victim, not the aggressor, she said, recalling a February Oval Office meeting where Zelenskyy was allegedly scolded for not being deferential enough. ‚ÄúI believe that peace at any price is not peace at all,‚Äù she said.\n\nTrump previously posted that his conversation with Putin would address ending the ‚Äúbloodbath‚Äù and might include discussions on trade; a possible sign that economic incentives could play a role in any deal. His administration has floated the idea of rethinking sanctions if Russia engages in good faith.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent reinforced this message, saying on NBC‚Äôs Meet the Press that sanctions could intensify if Putin doesn‚Äôt come to the table. He also criticised prior sanctions under President Joe Biden as ineffective for failing to curb Russia‚Äôs oil revenues.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAlthough hopes for a ceasefire remain elusive, Ukraine and Russia have agreed to a significant prisoner exchange ‚Äì 1,000 from each side ‚Äì potentially taking place this week, according to Ukrainian intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov.\n\nPutin recently declined Zelenskyy‚Äôs offer for an in-person meeting in Turkey, instead opting to wait until Trump was directly involved. ‚ÄúHe and I will meet, and I think we‚Äôll solve it or maybe not,‚Äù Trump said Friday while departing the Middle East. ‚ÄúAt least we‚Äôll know.‚Äù\n\nZelenskyy, meanwhile, met with Vice President Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Rome on Sunday. He later posted on X that their talks covered sanctions, defence cooperation, battlefield updates, and the upcoming prisoner swap. ‚ÄúPressure is needed against Russia until they are eager to stop the war,‚Äù he said.\n\nTrump also consulted with European leaders, including Germany‚Äôs Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron, ahead of his call with Putin. Macron later urged Putin to accept a proposed 30-day unconditional ceasefire backed by both Ukraine and Europe.\n\n(with inputs from agencies)"

        "full_content": "In an age when conflicts are dragging on and nations struggle to decide the correct time to terminate them, this military operation can serve as a template for others to follow in the future.\n\nLaunched to avenge the dastardly terror attack on innocent tourists in the popular destination of Pahalgam in Kashmir, the operation broke the back of terror in Pakistan. It delivered a blow from which Pakistan-based terror groups as well as the Pakistan military will take a long time to recover. More importantly, by agreeing to a ceasefire at Pakistan‚Äôs request just four days into the conflict, it is setting records as one of the shortest military engagements in the modern era.\n\nOperation Sindoor, a short, precise, and lethal military operation conducted by India, deep into Pakistan, has broken many glass ceilings and is setting benchmarks for the world to emulate.\n\nAlso Read: Op Sindoor: Inside story of what led Pakistan DGMO to make frantic calls for ‚Äòceasefire‚Äô\n\nWhat happened in Operation Sindoor\n\nOperation Sindoor was a three-night military operation from 7-10 May 2025. In the first phase, India launched coordinated air-launched missile and drone strikes against nine prominent terrorist locations in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), as well as deep inside Pakistan. These precision strikes were unprecedented in the history of the India‚ÄìPakistan conflict.\n\nThe fact that the strikes were delivered almost simultaneously over a frontage of hundreds of kilometres‚Äîstretching from Muzaffarabad in PoK to Bahawalpur in Pakistani Punjab‚Äîwithin a short span of about 30 minutes, left both the Pakistani state and the terror groups stunned, with no time to react. Also, the fact that four target locations were in Pakistan, across the international border, and included the headquarters of terror groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke, was unimaginable for the Pakistani military, adding to the shock and awe.\n\nOver the next two days, Pakistan tried to respond with waves of drone and missile strikes targeting India‚Äôs civilian and military infrastructure but was effectively thwarted by a well-integrated air defence system. In response, India took out Pakistan‚Äôs air defence systems and radars in prominent locations, including Lahore.\n\nOn the night of 9 May, India, exercising its right to respond, targeted 11 military airfields and other critical infrastructure in precision strikes across Pakistan, severely crippling its air power capability. Shocked and devastated by the damage inflicted, Pakistan was quick to request a ceasefire on 10 May, which India accepted.\n\nThe ceasefire ended the conflict, which is being termed by many commentators as one of the shortest and most effective military operations in modern history. A brief look at other recent conflicts in the world would give a better understanding and perhaps an appreciation of the military might and precision demonstrated by India in Operation Sindoor.\n\nWars that stretch on\n\nThe Gaza War, which commenced on 7 October 2023, triggered by a terror attack by Hamas into Israel, has been going on for over 20 months and shows no signs of ending. Reason? Despite a number of occasions when Israel was clearly ascendant and militarily dominant, it has not been able to call it off. To most military observers, it stems from two reasons. Firstly, the military objectives‚Äîwhich include ‚Äòeliminating Hamas from the face of the Earth forever‚Äô‚Äîare deemed unrealistic and difficult to accomplish on the ground. Secondly, on several occasions, a lack of synergy and growing discontent between the military, intelligence, and political leadership has come to the fore, leading to confused decision-making and stretched timelines.\n\nThen there‚Äôs the Russia-Ukraine War, which broke out on 24 February 2022 after Russia launched ‚ÄòSpecial Military Operations‚Äô against Ukraine. Despite initial claims that Russia would achieve its politico-military objectives in 20-30 days, the conflict continues even three years on with no immediate signs of resolution. Reason? Russia had three stated objectives: demilitarisation of Ukraine, denazification of Ukraine, and the declaration of independence of Russian-speaking areas, especially Donetsk and Luhansk. Although Russia has been dominant for the most part during these three years of conflict, the challenge has been to translate these objectives into clearly defined targets for the military to strike and capture. How does a military achieve the aim demilitarisation or denazification? Obviously, military support from Europe and the US has also contributed to the continuation of the conflict.\n\nWhen discussing long-drawn conflicts, the US-led war in Afghanistan cannot be left out. A war which began with targeting Al Qaeda bases to avenge the 9/11 terror attack soon morphed into a war against the Taliban, gradually moving into the space of political stabilisation and training Afghan military forces to defend themselves. Result? An unending campaign with no clearly defined objectives, which finally came to a close with the embarrassing overnight pullout of American forces in August 2021, leaving the Afghans at the mercy of the Taliban.\n\nMany other military campaigns ended a similar manner, like the war in Yemen, which went on for eight years, from March 2015 to March 2023, and still left the Houthis in charge.\n\nThe bottom line is that most countries have found it easy to get into a military conflict, but have not been able to devise a successful and effective exit strategy.\n\nLessons from Operation Sindoor\n\nOperation Sindoor avoided many of the pitfalls of other conflicts around the world.\n\nClearly defined military objectives. The operation was launched to target the terrorist outfits behind the Pahalgam attack. In striking nine locations in Pakistan, the Indian armed forces were precise in converting the military objective into action. The subsequent strikes on air defence targets and air bases in Pakistan were also based on clearly defined directions to strike back in response, and harder than the Pakistani effort. At no point did the military objectives stretch to include other possibilities like extending this operation to resolve territorial issues in PoK or Pakistan by undertaking ground operations or using naval forces for active kinetic action. This was a very important factor in enabling an early ceasefire.\n\nStrong and decisive political directives. In a country where terror strikes such as the Parliament attack in 2001 or 26/11 in Mumbai went unanswered, the scale, might, and depth of Operation Sindoor was an astonishing signal of political intent. The precise directive given to the armed forces, and the freedom to convert that political intent into military action, was a key factor in bringing down heavy punishment on terror groups and military infrastructure in Pakistan.\n\nSynergy and ‚Äòwhole of nation‚Äô approach. Operation Sindoor was a textbook example of synergy between the Army, Navy, Air Force, and even the Border Security Force and other security and intelligence agencies. Selection of targets, timely corroboration of intelligence by multiple sources, evacuation of citizens in Indian border areas to safer places, and vigilance to ensure that communal harmony within the country was not disturbed‚Äîall were conducted with great synergy and inter-agency coordination, leading to speedy achievement of military objectives with minimum losses.\n\nSelection and maintenance of aim (target). By carefully selecting the nine locations critical to terror infrastructure in Pakistan on 7 May, the air defence systems on 8 May, and thereafter the 11 air bases on 9 May, the Indian armed forces displayed exceptional focus in applying a very important principle of war: ‚Äòselection and maintenance of aim‚Äô. This was also a major contributory factor in the early declaration of ceasefire.\n\nNon-escalatory nature of operations. Right from the outset, India maintained a clear position that the objective was to target terror infrastructure, and that Pakistani military or civilian infrastructure was not a part of the war objectives. This was reiterated even after the strikes on Pakistan air defences and air bases, making it easier for India to accept Pakistan‚Äôs plea for an early ceasefire.\n\nKeeping the operations below the nuclear threshold. India kept the threat of Pakistan using nuclear weapons in mind while planning and executing operations. By not targeting any civilian areas or key civilian or military infrastructure (except air bases, that too in response to Pakistani air raids), and by not launching ground incursions deep into Pakistani territory or a naval blockade, India did not let Pakistan play victim or find grounds to explore the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nAlso Read: This is the new India‚Äîwe don‚Äôt return to business as usual after terror attacks\n\nOne for the history books\n\nOperation Sindoor was not only a successful military operation but has set many benchmarks for the world to follow. Among post‚ÄìWorld War 2 conflicts, only the Six-Day War of June 1967, fought between Israel and the Arab countries, comes close to such a bold, decisive, and swift military campaign.\n\nTherefore, Operation Sindoor will be studied, analysed, and remembered not only for its military precision and strong political intent but also for ending quickly, from a position of huge military and political advantage. It will definitely be remembered as a major turning point in India‚Äôs fight against terror and as a display of India‚Äôs military prowess and professionalism.\n\nCol Rajeev Agarwal is a Senior Research Consultant at Chintan Research Foundation.

        "full_content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with US Vice President JD Vance on Sunday, for the first time since their heated White House debate in February, as Russia launched a \"record\" drone barrage on Kyiv.The meeting came two days after the first direct talks between Ukraine and Russia in over three years. They were held in Turkey, where a prisoner exchange was agreed but no progress made on securing a ceasefire.\"We discussed the talks in Istanbul, where the Russians sent a low-level delegation with no decision-making powers,\" Zelensky wrote on Telegram following the meeting with Vance at the US ambassador's residence in Rome.Both men had earlier attended Pope Leo's inaugural mass at the Vatican.\"We also touched on the need for sanctions against Russia, bilateral trade, defence cooperation, the situation on the battlefield and the future exchange of prisoners,\" Zelensky added.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Zelensky's aide Andriy Yermak were also present.In a short statement, the White House said \"the leaders discussed their shared goal of ending the bloodshed in Ukraine and provided updates on the current state of negotiations for a ceasefire and lasting peace.\"A photo accompanying the statement showed Vance and Zelensky with broad smiles, a sharp contrast to their bitter February clash in the Oval Office.Vance also held a meeting with the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Italy's Prime Minister Georgia Meloni that the White House later described as \"constructive.\"A senior Ukrainian official from the president's office, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told AFP that Zelensky and Vance discussed preparations for Monday's telephone conversation between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on Saturday that he would speak by phone with Putin on Monday in order to stop the \"BLOODBATH\" in Ukraine.The leaders of Britain, Germany and France also want to talk to Trump ahead of that call with Putin, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said.The US president has increased pressure on Ukraine and so far abstained from criticising Putin, who started the biggest conflict in Europe since World War Two.'Better' talks==================The official said that the Rome encounter went \"better\" than the Oval Office row three months ago.Then, Vance publically accused Zelensky of being \"disrespectful\" towards Trump, who told the Ukrainian leader he should be more grateful and that he had no \"cards\" to play in negotiations with Russia.Zelensky and his wife Olena Zelenska were earlier granted an audience with Leo following his inauguration.\"We thank the Vatican for its willingness to become a platform for direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia,\" Ukraine's leader said after meeting the pontiff.\"The martyred Ukraine is waiting for negotiations for a just and lasting peace to finally happen,\" Leo XIV said during his inauguration.'Record' drone barrage===========================Ukraine on Sunday said that Russia had launched a record number of drones at the country overnight, targeting various regions, including the capital Kyiv, where a woman was killed.Another man was killed in the southeastern Kherson region, where a railway station and private houses and cars were hit.The Ukrainian air force said that Russia had launched \"273 Shahed attack drones and various types of imitator drones\", of which 88 were destroyed and 128 more went astray \"without negative consequences\".Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said it was a \"record\" number of drones. \"Russia has a clear goal -- to continue killing civilians,\" she said.The Russian military said it had intercepted 25 Ukrainian drones overnight and on Sunday morning. Moscow also claimed it had captured Bahatyr, another village in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region, as it intensifies the war effort despite the Istanbul peace talks.'Root causes'=================In an interview with Russian state TV published on Sunday, Putin said that Moscow's aim was to \"eliminate the causes that triggered this crisis, create the conditions for a lasting peace and guarantee Russia's security\", without elaborating further.Russia's references to the \"root causes\" of the conflict typically refer to alleged grievances with Kyiv and the West that Moscow has put forward as justification for launching the invasion in February 2022.They include pledges to \"de-Nazify\" and demilitarise Ukraine, protect Russian speakers in the country's east, push back against NATO expansion and stop Ukraine's westward geopolitical drift.Kyiv and the West say that Russia's invasion is nothing more than an imperial-style land grab.Tens of thousands have been killed since Russia started the war, with millions forced to flee their homes.Friday's talks in Turkey led to an agreement to exchange 1,000 prisoners each."

        "full_content": "After all the speculation about how Russian President Vladimir Putin would respond to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky‚Äôs offer to meet for peace talks in Istanbul, it isn‚Äôt surprising that Mr. Putin declined. Instead he sent a low-level delegation, headed by the ultraconservative former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky.\n\nHaving repeatedly declared Mr. Zelensky‚Äôs government illegitimate, Mr. Putin would have made a huge concession‚Äîand appeared weak‚Äîif he had met with Mr. Zelensky. More important, a meeting between the two, which President Trump had suggested he might attend as well, wouldn‚Äôt have achieved much. Mr. Putin relishes being a wartime leader and is determined to continue the conflict until Ukraine is coerced into becoming a ‚Äúfriendly\" neighbor.\n\nIn keeping with Mr. Trump‚Äôs stance that Russia isn‚Äôt the aggressor in the Ukraine war, a White House proposal to end the conflict, crafted last month, made major concessions to the Kremlin, legitimizing Russia‚Äôs occupation of Crimea and granting Russia all the territory it has gained since the war began. The plan also proposed a gradual lifting of the economic sanctions against Russia that were imposed in 2014, as well as a promise that Ukraine won‚Äôt join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. When Mr. Zelensky rejected the deal, Mr. Trump accused him of being ‚Äúinflammatory\" and suggested that he‚Äînot Mr. Putin‚Äîwas the problem.\n\nMr. Trump began to change his tune after Russia‚Äôs deadly April 24 missile and drone attack on Kyiv, saying the strikes were unnecessary and ‚Äúvery bad timing.\" Then, following a meeting with Mr. Zelensky before the funeral of Pope Francis, Mr. Trump questioned Mr. Putin‚Äôs interest in a peace deal and raised the possibility of new sanctions against Russia. He also said Russia had stolen Crimea from Ukraine. The sudden signing of an economic partnership agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine, announced April 30, further suggested that Mr. Trump was shifting to a more favorable stance toward Ukraine as he grew frustrated with Russia‚Äôs response to peace proposals.\n\nMeanwhile, top officials in Mr. Putin‚Äôs government began talking tough. On April 24 the head of Russia‚Äôs security council, former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, addressed proposals for a Western peacekeeping contingent in Ukraine to monitor compliance with a future cease-fire. Stating that Russia had invaded Ukraine because of the threat of NATO military deployment in Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúhistorical territory\" inside Ukraine, Mr. Shoigu said that the introduction of foreign troops in Ukraine could lead to a direct military conflict between Russia and NATO countries.\n\nIn an interview with the Russian news agency TASS on April 29, Mr. Shoigu‚Äôs predecessor and Putin ally Nikolai Patrushev, now an adviser to the Russian president, claimed that NATO was conducting naval exercises with nuclear-armed submarines and working out scenarios for a ‚Äúnuclear apocalypse\" with strikes on Russian bases that house nuclear weapons. In an April 28 interview Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov laid out Russia‚Äôs maximalist demands for peace negotiations that went well beyond those in the Trump proposal.\n\nAgainst this backdrop Mr. Putin made an offer for Ukrainian and Russian negotiators to meet directly in Istanbul, without accepting a proposal for a 30-day truce supported by Ukraine, the U.S. and the European members of NATO as a precondition for further peace talks. Mr. Trump jumped on Mr. Putin‚Äôs proposal, leaving the Europeans and Ukrainians at a loss. Mr. Zelensky took a gamble and not only agreed but said he would attend, putting Mr. Putin in a difficult position.\n\nThe day before the talks began, Mr. Putin and his top security and defense team met with Mr. Medinsky to prepare for the negotiations. If these men were concerned that Mr. Putin‚Äôs absence would reinforce Mr. Trump‚Äôs doubts about their leader‚Äôs intentions for peace, they were probably reassured by Mr. Trump‚Äôs subsequent statement: ‚ÄúNothing‚Äôs going to happen until Putin and I get together\"‚Äîsuggesting that the two can still reach a peace deal without including Mr. Zelensky.\n\nMr. Trump apparently doesn‚Äôt understand that Mr. Putin isn‚Äôt ready to end hostilities. He said on Fox News Friday that ‚ÄúPutin is tired of the war.\" But, as Russian commentator Maksim Katz pointed out on May 13, Mr. Putin seems to enjoy the conflict: ‚ÄúPutin blossoms whenever he talks about war. Instead of an aging dictator, he appears as a military leader, a character in some exciting movie that is playing in real time 3D right around him.\"\n\nHaving rallied his people to support a patriotic struggle against Western enemies and fueled Russia‚Äôs economic growth with massive military spending, Mr. Putin wants Mr. Trump to cut off arms deliveries and crucial intelligence to Ukraine so that Russian troops can move beyond their snail‚Äôs-pace offensive and gain substantial swaths of Ukrainian territory. With this goal in mind, Mr. Putin is going along with the negotiations in the hope that Mr. Trump eventually will give up on a peace settlement and walk away from the conflict altogether.\n\nAs expected, Friday‚Äôs talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations failed to make progress because the Russians put forth their usual maximalist demands. The next day Mr. Trump announced that he will be talking by phone with Mr. Putin on Monday, and plans to call Mr. Zelensky after. Mr. Trump should make clear to Mr. Putin that if Russia doesn‚Äôt agree to a 30-day cease-fire and back off from its demands, the U.S. will keep providing Ukraine with the military aid necessary to defend itself against Russian aggression.\n\nMs. Knight is author, most recently, of ‚ÄúThe Kremlin‚Äôs Noose: Putin‚Äôs Bitter Feud With the Oligarch Who Made Him Ruler of Russia.\""

The EU has estimated that $221.5 billion out of approximately $300 billion worth of frozen Russian assets are held in the 27-nation bloc, primarily in the form of government bonds that the Bank of Russia, the nation's central bank, had stored as reserves, a Reuters report said.\n\nThe EU has also said that it expected these assets were capable of yielding about $16-$22 billion in interest earned by 2027 as well, subject to fluctuations in euro zone rates, a related report said.\n\nALSO READ | 'Stop the bloodbath': Trump to call Putin, Zelenskyy, NATO leaders in fresh push for ceasefire\n\n‚ÄúWe were able to negotiate additional funding for Finland‚Äôs support for Ukraine ...

        "full_content": "The first high level talks between Russia and Ukraine since the early months of Moscow‚Äôs 2022 attack showed they are far from agreement on steps needed for a ceasefire, even though they promised a major swap of prisoners of war. read more\n\nThe first high-level talks between Russia and Ukraine since the early stages of Moscow‚Äôs 2022 attack have concluded with a stark reminder of the immense gulf separating the two nations, offering scant optimism for an imminent ceasefire. Despite promises of a major prisoner swap, the talks revealed a profound lack of common ground on the fundamental steps required to stop the ongoing conflict.\n\nDespite the palpable distance in their positions, a sliver of diplomatic possibility remains. Turkey, the host nation said that both Russia and Ukraine had agreed in principle to hold further negotiations. The statement offers a glimmer of hope for US President Donald Trump, who has called for a swift peace agreement.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nPeter Slezkine, senior fellow and director of the Russia program at the Stimson Center, described the talks as ‚Äúsubstantial steps.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúI do think that they are a very hopeful sign, because the two sides coming into direct contact is an important development.‚Äù\n\nHowever, the initial optimism generated by the meeting quickly faded upon closer examination of the stated positions. Ukraine, backed by the United States and other Western allies, has consistently called for a 30-day ceasefire without any preconditions to facilitate meaningful peace negotiations.\n\nIn stark contrast, Russia, which currently occupies nearly a fifth of Ukrainian territory, displayed minimal inclination towards compromise. Moscow reiterated its maximalist demands, insisting on Ukraine‚Äôs withdrawal from and recognition of Russia‚Äôs claim over four Ukrainian regions ‚Äì territories the Kremlin unilaterally annexed but does not fully control.\n\nThe carefully worded statements released by both sides following the Istanbul talks did little to conceal the deep chasm that persists between them. A Ukrainian diplomatic source, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the discussions, revealed that Russia presented demands that were ‚Äúdetached from reality and go far beyond anything that was previously discussed.‚Äù These reportedly included ultimatums for Ukrainian forces to withdraw from sovereign Ukrainian land, alongside ‚Äúother nonstarters and non-constructive conditions.‚Äù\n\nAdding a chilling perspective, the Kremlin‚Äôs chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, suggested that Russia was prepared to continue its military campaign for as long as necessary to achieve its objectives. Drawing a historical parallel to Russia‚Äôs protracted 18th-century war against Sweden, he argued that Kyiv‚Äôs resistance to Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúpeace demands‚Äù was only hastening its own demise.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nA senior Ukrainian government official with direct knowledge of the abortive 2022 peace talks with Russia expressed little surprise at the outcome in Istanbul, telling Reuters that it unfolded ‚Äúentirely as expected.‚Äù The source offered a more pragmatic, if less hopeful, view: ‚Äú‚ÄòEvery journey begins with a single step. This is the beginning of the journey. Demands are always exaggerated at the start of any negotiations. That‚Äôs classic.‚Äô‚Äù\n\nThe fragile outcome places renewed emphasis on President Trump‚Äôs role. Just before the talks, Trump abruptly shifted stance, saying he needed a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to achieve a breakthrough. This move temporarily undercut European efforts to pressure Washington into imposing tougher sanctions on Russia.\n\nEarlier in the week, leaders of four major European powers had visited Kyiv, warning Russia of fresh sanctions if it failed to agree to a 30-day ceasefire by May 12, a position supported by the US However, when Putin proposed talks instead of a ceasefire, Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on social media to accept the proposal immediately, without mentioning impending sanctions.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nZelenskyy, wary of alienating the influential US President, publicly supported direct talks with Putin. The Kremlin‚Äôs response was to dispatch a delegation for the Istanbul talks that conspicuously excluded Putin himself, as well as any high-ranking ministers.\n\nRussian political analyst Vladimir Pastukhov wryly commented on the appointment of Medinsky, a figure from the failed 2022 talks, as delegation head, saying, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt send undertakers to a wedding.‚Äù\n\nAfter the Istanbul talks, Trump and the leaders of the four European powers spoke again with Zelenskyy to discuss the way forward. Publicly, the Ukrainian team renewed calls for direct negotiations between Zelenskyy and Putin, arguing only the Russian president has the authority to resolve key issues.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News, Trump expressed optimism about reaching an agreement but added that he would impose sanctions on Russia if no deal could be made.\n\nWhile the talks represent a diplomatic step forward, the entrenched positions and expansive Russian demands suggest that a genuine ceasefire remains elusive for now, raising questions over whether the negotiations mark the beginning of peace or merely a strategic ploy in a protracted conflict.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD"

Image- AFP\n\nThe first face-to-face talks between Ukraine and Russia in over three years ended Friday without a ceasefire agreement, with Kyiv dismissing Moscow‚Äôs conditions as ‚Äúnon-starters‚Äù while both sides agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war ‚Äì the largest such swap since the war began.\n\nThe meeting, held in Istanbul‚Äôs Dolmabahce Palace, lasted less than two hours. Although the two sides agreed in principle to swap 1,000 prisoners of war each ‚Äî the largest such exchange to date ‚Äî the broader goal of peace remained elusive.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nRussia reportedly introduced new and ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù demands, including the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from large territories, according to a senior Ukrainian official speaking on condition of anonymity. These terms, never previously discussed, were rejected outright by Kyiv. ‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs demands were detached from reality,‚Äù said a source in Ukraine‚Äôs delegation.\n\nDivergent Red Lines\n\nRussia expressed satisfaction with the talks and readiness for further contacts, but Ukrainian officials revealed Moscow had introduced unexpected conditions, including Ukrainian troop withdrawals from large occupied areas. ‚ÄúThese proposals had never been discussed before,‚Äù a senior Ukrainian official told The Associated Press anonymously.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi confirmed Russia made ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù demands but said Kyiv‚Äôs delegation maintained its stance calmly. The Ukrainian side reiterated its focus on achieving an immediate truce and a diplomatic roadmap aligned with US and European proposals.\n\nThe Trump Factor\n\nUS President Donald Trump, who has pressured both sides to end Europe‚Äôs bloodiest conflict since WWII, said negotiations wouldn‚Äôt progress until he meets Vladimir Putin. ‚ÄúNothing‚Äôs going to happen until Putin and I get together,‚Äù Trump told reporters in Abu Dhabi. Putin notably skipped the Istanbul talks, prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also absent to deride Russia‚Äôs delegation as ‚Äúdummies.‚Äù\n\nZelenskyy immediately rallied Western allies post-talks, urging tougher sanctions if Moscow rejects a 30-day ceasefire proposal. He held calls with Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and Polish leader Donald Tusk.\n\nA Theater of Diplomacy?\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan opened the talks, urging participants to seize the opportunity for peace, calling a ceasefire ‚Äúcritically important.‚Äù While both sides agreed in principle to meet again, the day‚Äôs events suggested the negotiations served more as a stage for grievances than a pathway to peace.\n\nRussia‚Äôs lead negotiator Vladimir Medinsky had earlier said readiness for ‚Äúpossible compromises,‚Äù without details. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy‚Äôs team emphasised they would only engage in top-level talks with Putin present ‚Äì a condition the Kremlin continues to ignore.\n\nWith the prisoner swap as the sole concrete outcome, the Istanbul meeting highlighted how far apart the two nations remain after 27 months of war. As Ukraine pushes for Western-backed solutions and Russia floats unspecified compromises, the talks appeared less about making peace than managing its impossibility."

From then on, we see Kornev (Alexander Kuznetsov) attempting in all earnestness to try and meet the prisoner, who is at first only a number in a cell. The bloody weals on his body shock the young law graduate, and he sets out to meet the senior prosecutor, in the hope that the latter‚Äôs intervention will help rectify matters.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nLoznitsa is in familiar territory, having given us glimpses into the labyrinthine workings of Russia and his native Ukraine in his earlier work.\n\n‚ÄòTwo Prosectors‚Äô doesn‚Äôt deviate from bleakness, but is possibly his most accessible film in the manner in which he depicts a system, locked and loaded against the less powerful. If you are below in the pecking order, there you will remain, so do not go about getting ideas above your station.\n\nThe tussle between the two prosecutors, on either side of the spectrum, one just beginning his journey, the other on top, could well have been the subject of a Kafka novel.\n\nNothing is stated. Open hostility can be combated, but there‚Äôs nothing you can do with a perfectly calibrated official disdain that keeps you waiting endlessly, without granting you a meeting.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAdapted from political activist and gulag survivor Georgy Demidov‚Äôs 1969 book, the brooding, atmospheric ‚ÄòTwo Prosecutors‚Äô will put you in mind of Kafka and Solzhenitsyn, and so many others who wrote movingly about a ruthless regime where human rights were turned into a joke. When Kornev requests a meeting with the prison warden, the guard can‚Äôt believe it, and when he informs the man guarding a higher gate, they both burst out laughing. Some random person asking to be let into their sanctum, where they are the masters of the skeletal inmates who keep dropping dead of overwork? Preposterous.\n\nThe thing with Kornev is that he just doesn‚Äôt learn. He does, finally, get to meet with the USSR‚Äôs top prosecutor (Vytautas Kaniuonis). But the reception is cold, and as he recounts the story of the prisoner and his quest, it gets colder still, and the consequence is chilling.\n\nWhat makes the well-performed ‚ÄòTwo Prosecutors‚Äô such a compelling watch is that it may speak of a bygone era, but with rising authoritarianism in so many parts of the world, it feels even more sharply relevant.\n\nAbsolute power corrupts absolutely. ‚ÄòDossier 137‚Äô, a police procedural deftly directed by Dominik Moll, has a thematic similarity with ‚ÄòTwo Prosecutors‚Äô in the way it shows how traditional power structures are kept in place by every single stakeholder. Those who rock the boat are considered trouble-mongers, not the actual perpetrators themselves.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe French movie, also in competition, unfolds as a series of interrogations interspersed with bursts of action in Paris and the countryside. When a young man is shot and badly injured during a demonstration that turns violent, conscientious police officer Stephanie ( Lea Drucker) starts to investigate. She finds many troubling facts and a cover-up: as it is, she is part of a much-reviled group tasked to keep an eye on internal affairs, and in this instance, she finds, through a video of the incident, that her colleagues were directly involved.\n\nWhat follows is hard to watch as the complicit cops show that they are masters at deflection and active lying. Stephanie‚Äôs superior takes her up on a fact she believes the former kept deliberately hidden: that she belongs to the same town as the victim, and that that makes her biased. Racism is at work here too, in the shape of a black cleaner who displays the weary cynicism of the oppressed. When you know you aren‚Äôt going to win, what‚Äôs the point of making a noise and calling attention to yourself?\n\nMay as well watch cat videos, the way an old lady does in the movie, to keep the darkness at bay."

This shift comes as Syria‚Äôs new leadership builds stronger ties with Gulf Arab and Western countries following the easing of some sanctions.\n\nSyrian officials are in talks with Oumolat, a UAE-based company, to produce the newly designed banknotes. Two Syrian financial sources confirmed to Reuters that the central bank governor and finance minister visited the firm in the UAE earlier this month.\n\n‚ÄúThe discussions with Oumolat are at an advanced stage,‚Äù one Syrian source said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAlso read | Trump announces end to US sanctions on Syria\n\nThe move marks a break from Russia, which had printed Syrian money throughout the 13-year conflict. Russia took over after European Union sanctions halted Syria‚Äôs contract with a European printer. Despite the planned shift, Damascus continues to receive Russian financial and material support, including cash, wheat and fuel, as Moscow maintains its military presence in Syria.\n\nOne European official told Reuters that two German companies, the state-backed Bundesdruckerei and private firm Giesecke+Devrient, had shown interest in printing Syrian currency. However, a spokesperson for Bundesdruckerei said the company was ‚Äúnot in talks for a currency-printing deal with the Syrian state,‚Äù while Giesecke+Devrient declined to comment.\n\nOfficials from the UAE foreign ministry, the German government and Syria‚Äôs central bank did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe redesigned notes will no longer feature Bashar al-Assad‚Äôs image, according to the three sources.

On Thursday, Syria signed an $800 million preliminary agreement with the UAE‚Äôs DP World to develop the port of Tartus. This is the first major foreign deal announced since the United States said earlier this week it would lift sanctions on Syria‚Äôs economy.\n\nIn February, the European Union also suspended some of its financial sanctions on Syria, including measures that had prevented the country from printing currency through European firms.\n\nSyria‚Äôs economy remains fragile, worsened by a shortage of physical cash. Officials say people are hoarding banknotes, while bankers suggest authorities are limiting circulation to manage the exchange rate. As a result, banks often reject depositors and businesses who try to withdraw money.\n\nThe Syrian pound, which traded at 50 per US dollar before the war in 2011, was valued at about 10,000 per dollar on the black market on Friday. That‚Äôs an improvement from earlier this year, when it was around 15,000.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nWhile the new Syrian leadership is trying to reform the economy and rebuild external relations, its links to Russia remain a point of concern for some European states, especially in light of the war in Ukraine."

        "full_content": "ANKARA, Turkey : Russia and Ukraine are set to hold their first direct peace talks in three years, both countries said Thursday, but hopes for a breakthrough remained dim after Russian President Vladimir Putin spurned an offer by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to meet face-to-face in Turkey.\n\nZelenskyy said he is sending a team headed by his defense minister from the Turkish capital Ankara to Istanbul to meet a Russian delegation, even though Moscow's side doesn‚Äôt include ‚Äúanyone who actually makes decisions.‚Äù\n\nThe Ukrainian side would be headed by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and its aim is ‚Äúto attempt at least the first steps toward de-escalation, the first steps toward ending the war ‚Äî namely, a ceasefire,‚Äù he said.\n\nFew had expected Putin to show up in Turkey, and his absence punctured any hope of significant progress toward ending the 3-year-old war amid peace efforts in recent months by the Trump administration and Western European leaders. It also raised the prospect of intensified international sanctions on Russia that have been threatened by the West.\n\nZelenskyy, who flew Thursday to Ankara after challenging Putin to sit down with him, accused Moscow of not making a serious effort to end the war by sending a low-level negotiating team that he described as ‚Äúa theater prop.‚Äù\n\nHis proposal to Putin came amid a flurry of maneuvering last weekend as each side sought a diplomatic advantage.\n\nZelenskyy said he decided to send the delegation to Istanbul to demonstrate to U.S. President Donald Trump that Ukraine wants to end the fighting.\n\nThe war has killed tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides and more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians, according to the U.N. Russian forces are preparing a fresh military offensive , Ukrainian government and Western military analysts say.\n\nAt least five civilians were killed and 29 wounded in the past day, according to authorities in five eastern regions of Ukraine where Russia is trying to advance.\n\nThe head of the Russian delegation, presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, said in Istanbul that the representatives were ready to meet Ukrainian officials.\n\n‚ÄúThe task of these direct negotiations with Ukraine is to establish long-term peace sooner or later by eliminating the root causes of this conflict,‚Äù he said in a brief statement.\n\nIt was not clear when they would meet. The Russian state news agency Tass reported that the talks will go ahead Friday, citing an unidentified source.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he would confer Friday in Istanbul with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and the Ukrainian delegation, adding that the Russian delegation would be meeting with other members of the U.S. team and that he hoped all sides could get together.\n\n‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have high expectations of what will happen tomorrow. And frankly, at this point, I think it‚Äôs abundantly clear that the only way we‚Äôre going to have a breakthrough here is between President Trump and President Putin,‚Äù Rubio told reporters in Antalya, Turkey, where he was attending a NATO foreign ministers meeting .\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier welcomed Zelenskyy to the presidential palace in Ankara for their own talks. Zelenskyy heads Friday to Albania for a gathering of European officials.\n\nWeekend maneuvers The diplomatic maneuvering began Saturday when European leaders met Zelenskyy in Kyiv and urged the Kremlin to agree to a full, unconditional 30-day ceasefire as a first step toward peace. Putin responded early Sunday by proposing direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul. Then came Zelenskyy's challenge to Putin for face-to-face talks.\n\nAfter days of silence, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov finally said Thursday that Putin had no plans to travel to Istanbul in the next few days.\n\nTrump said he was not surprised that Putin was a no-show. He had pressed for Putin and Zelenskyy to meet but brushed off the Kremlin leader‚Äôs decision not to attend.\n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think it was possible for Putin to go if I‚Äôm not there,‚Äù Trump told reporters in Doha, Qatar, on the third day of his visit to the Middle East.\n\nTrump said a meeting between him and Putin was crucial to breaking the deadlock.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe anything‚Äôs going to happen whether you like it or not, until (Putin) and I get together,‚Äù he said on Air Force One while traveling from Doha to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre going to have to get it solved because too many people are dying.‚Äù\n\nPeskov said Putin has no plans to meet with Trump in the coming days.\n\nMedinsky, Putin's aide, is leading the Russian team that also includes three other senior officials, the Kremlin said. Putin also appointed four lower-level officials as ‚Äúexperts‚Äù for the talks in Istanbul.\n\nAlso absent from the talks were Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin‚Äôs foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov, both of whom represented Russia at talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia in March.\n\nThe top-level Ukrainian delegation included Umerov, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and the head of the Ukrainian presidential office, Andriy Yermak, a Ukrainian official said. Zelenskyy will sit at the negotiating table only with Putin, said presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak.\n\nPutin met Wednesday with senior government officials and members of the delegation in preparation for the talks, Peskov said. Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, General Staff chief Valery Gerasimov and National Security Council secretary Sergei Shoigu attended.\n\nRussia calls the talks a ‚Äòrestart‚Äô The Kremlin billed the Istanbul talks as a ‚Äúrestart‚Äù of peace negotiations held there in 2022 that quickly collapsed. Moscow accused Ukraine and the West of wanting to continue fighting, while Kyiv said Russia‚Äôs demands amounted to an ultimatum, not something both sides could agree on. That delegation also was also headed by Medinsky.\n\nPutin's proposal came after more than three months of diplomacy kick-started by Trump, who promised during his campaign to end the war swiftly ‚Äî although it's been hard to pull off . The Trump administration in recent weeks indicated it might walk away from the effort if there was no tangible progress soon.\n\nSybiha, the Ukrainian foreign minister, met with Rubio and Sen. Lindsey Graham on Wednesday night in Antalya.\n\nSybiha reaffirmed Ukraine‚Äôs support for Trump‚Äôs mediation efforts and thanked the U.S. for its continued involvement, urging Moscow to ‚Äúreciprocate Ukraine‚Äôs constructive steps‚Äù toward peace. \"So far, it has not,‚Äù Sybiha said.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Sybiha also met with other European foreign ministers, including his French counterpart Jean-No√´l Barrot, who in a post on X reiterated the call for a ceasefire and the threat of ‚Äúmassive sanctions‚Äù if Russia doesn't comply.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a very difficult spot right now, and we hope that we can find the steps forward that provide for the end of this war in a negotiated way and the prevention of any war in the future,\" Rubio said Thursday.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer accused Putin of ‚Äústanding in the way of peace.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThere was only one country that started this conflict ‚Äî that was Russia. That was Putin. There‚Äôs only one country now standing in the way of peace ‚Äî that is Russia, that is Putin,‚Äù he said in a visit to Tirana, Albania.\n\nBarrot echoed that sentiment: ‚ÄúIn front of Ukrainians, there is an empty chair, one that should have been occupied by Vladimir Putin,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúVladimir Putin is dragging his feet and in all evidence does not want to enter into these peace discussions.‚Äù\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Lorne Cook in Brussels; Illia Novikov and Samya Kullab in Kyiv, Ukraine; Dasha Litvinova in Tallinn, Estonia; Aamer Madhani in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; and Matthew Lee in Antalya, Turkey, contributed to this report."

The goal is to reinforce the slogan 'Trade, not aid,' as the cornerstone of U.S.-Africa relations.\n\nU.S. commitments include a $550 million loan for the Lobito rail corridor to counter China and Russia's growing influence in Africa, particularly in the mineral and trade sectors. Criticized for its aid cuts, the U.S. aims to enhance economic diplomacy, business-friendly reforms, and support for infrastructure projects to boost trade relationships ahead of the upcoming U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

        "full_content": "Attention will be on Istanbul today, where many hope progress might be made in ending Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now in its third year, as delegations from both countries prepare for talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he would head to Istanbul at a moment‚Äôs notice if Russian President Vladimir Putin turns up. However, the list doesn‚Äôt include the Russian leader read more\n\nDelegations from Kyiv and Moscow are set to meet in Istanbul on Thursday for the first face-to-face discussion between the two sides since March 2022.\n\nThe Kremlin confirmed on Wednesday that a Russian team will be in Istanbul for possible direct peace talks with Ukraine. However, Vladimir Putin isn‚Äôt on the list of officials, indicating he will not be present for the meet.\n\nTalks have previously taken place in cities such as Moscow, Kyiv, Washington, and Riyadh, as well as across Europe. Now, attention is focused on Istanbul, where many hope progress might be made in ending Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now in its third year.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has suggested restarting direct peace negotiations with Ukraine in the Turkish city. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on him to meet in person in Turkey.\n\nZelenskyy said on Tuesday, ‚ÄúIf Putin does not arrive and plays games, it is the final point that he does not want to end the war.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian president is expected to meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara. He said he would head to Istanbul at a moment‚Äôs notice if Putin turns up.\n\n‚ÄúIf Putin does not arrive and plays games, it is the final point [showing] that he does not want to end the war. Trump needs to believe that Putin actually lies,‚Äù he said.\n\nWhat can we expect from the talks? Could this meeting bring an end to the war? Which leaders will be there? We will also take a look at the situation on the ground as these talks unfold in Turkey.\n\nHow did the idea of talks began?\n\nOn Saturday, Zelenskyy hosted French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in a show of unity. They issued a coordinated call for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine starting Monday.\n\nThe plan has received backing from the European Union and U.S. President Donald Trump, who had promised during his campaign to swiftly end the war that is now in its fourth year. The leaders pledged tougher sanctions on Russia if Putin did not accept the proposal.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nIn remarks to the media early Sunday, however, Putin effectively rejected the offer and proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul instead ‚Äúwithout preconditions.‚Äù He did not specify whether he envisioned the talks to involve Zelenskyy and himself personally, or with lower-level officials.\n\nZelenskyy responded by insisting on a ceasefire, saying he will travel to Turkey ‚Äî and challenged Putin to do the same: ‚ÄúI will be waiting for Putin in (Turkey) on Thursday. Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses.‚Äù\n\nWho will be attending?\n\nPressed by reporters on who will represent Russia in Istanbul, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to say, stressing that Putin had outlined Russia‚Äôs position clearly enough.\n\nTrump‚Äôs administration initiated separate talks with Russia and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia in March. But since then, the administration has indicated it might withdraw from the process if no tangible progress is made. Trump said Monday he was optimistic about the talks ‚Äî a sharp contrast to a contentious Oval Office meeting with Zelenskyy on Feb. 28.\n\nThere is ‚Äúthe potential for a good meeting‚Äù between Putin and Zelenskyy, Trump said in Washington. He added he was ‚Äúthinking about flying over‚Äù after his visit to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates but later said Secretary of State Marco Rubio and others from the U.S. will go to Turkey for the talks.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nPodolyak on Tuesday told a YouTube broadcast by prominent Russian journalists in exile that the Ukrainian leader won‚Äôt be meeting any Russian officials in Istanbul other than Putin.\n\nHe added that ‚Äúthere are always people‚Äù in Zelenskyy‚Äôs entourage who can ‚Äúconduct certain negotiations at corresponding levels‚Äù with the Russians but questioned the point of a lower-level meeting. ‚ÄúUndoubtedly, only Putin can make the decision to continue the war or stop the war,‚Äù he said.\n\nThe Ukrainian president is expected to meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara. AP\n\nZelenskyy said Tuesday he will meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the capital Ankara, and wait there. If the Russian leader chooses Istanbul for the meeting, Zelenskyy said, then he and Erdogan will travel there.\n\nIf Putin doesn‚Äôt show, European and U.S. leaders should follow through with additional sanctions against Russia, he added.\n\nWhat happened at the talks in Istanbul in 2022?\n\nThe Kremlin billed Thursday‚Äôs talks as a ‚Äúrestarting‚Äù of peace negotiations in Istanbul in 2022, early on in the war, that quickly fell apart. Moscow had blamed Ukraine and the West for their alleged desire to continue fighting, while Kyiv said Russia‚Äôs demands amounted to an ultimatum rather than something the sides could mutually agree on.\n\nZelenskyy has said the Russian delegation‚Äôs demands included Ukraine‚Äôs recognition of Russian control over the Donbas, an area in eastern Ukraine consisting of Donetsk and Luhansk regions; constitutional amendments to declare neutrality; a significant reduction of Ukraine‚Äôs armed forces; and the surrender of long-range weaponry. ‚ÄúThere were never any negotiations; it was an ultimatum from a murderer,‚Äù he said in 2022.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nPutin accused Ukraine of derailing a peace deal that was basically agreed on and included clauses of Ukraine‚Äôs neutral and nonnuclear status and details on how much its army would be reduced. ‚ÄúThe Kyiv authorities ‚Ä¶ just threw it all away. They turned it down,‚Äù Putin said in 2023.\n\nThe Kremlin has said repeatedly ‚Äúthe Istanbul agreements‚Äù could serve as a basis for further peace talks. After Moscow illegally annexed the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in September 2022, Russian authorities started saying that Kyiv should also recognise ‚Äúthe reality on the ground.‚Äù\n\nWhat are their demands to end the war?\n\nPutin last year demanded that Ukraine cede the four regions, which it still does not fully control. He also wants Kyiv to recognise the Crimean Peninsula, also illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014, as Russian; Ukraine also must renounce its bid to join NATO and drastically reduce its army. He also demanded that the West lift sanctions imposed on Moscow after the invasion.\n\nKyiv, in turn, refused to cede any land and wants robust security guarantees against future Russian aggression.\n\nTrump, who has engaged in a broad diplomatic effort to end the war since taking office, has said that Crimea, ‚Äúwill stay with Russia.‚Äù He has also said that Kyiv was unlikely to ever join Nato.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin in the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow. AP\n\nWhat‚Äôs happening on the battlefield?\n\nBoth sides are preparing a warm weather campaign on the battlefield, where a war of attrition has killed tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides along the roughly 1,000-kilometre (620-mile) front line.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said Russia is ‚Äúquickly replenishing front-line units with new recruits to maintain the battlefield initiative.‚Äù\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nIn 2024 and more recently, Russian troops have made slow but steady gains in several sections along the front.\n\nPutin said in March that Russian troops have ‚Äúgained steam‚Äù and ‚Äúare holding strategic initiative all along the line of contact.‚Äù Zelenskyy warned that Russia was delaying talks in preparation for bigger offensives.\n\nLast month, Moscow‚Äôs forces also declared that they fully reclaimed chunks of Russia‚Äôs Kursk region bordering Ukraine that Kyiv‚Äôs forces seized in a surprise incursion in August 2024. Kyiv denied the claim, but it has been steadily losing ground there as Moscow, aided by North Korean soldiers, worked to push them out and leave Ukraine without a key negotiating chip.\n\nSeveral attempts to establish at least a partial ceasefire have been unsuccessful. Russia effectively rejected a 30-day unconditional truce; the Kremlin instead declared two short, unilateral ceasefires for holidays in the last two months ‚Äì‚Äì one for 30 hours at Easter and another for 72 hours to coincide with Russia‚Äôs World War II Victory Day celebrations. In both cases, Kyiv and Moscow accused each other of failing to halt the fighting.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nRussia and Ukraine also pledged in March to observe a 30-day halt to attacking energy infrastructure that was brokered by the Trump administration. Both sides repeatedly accused each other of massive violations until the measure expired.\n\nWith inputs from AP"
