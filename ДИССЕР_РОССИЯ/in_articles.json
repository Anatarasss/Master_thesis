We are waiting.”\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow's defence ministry claimed to have shot down 105 of Kyiv's drones overnight—the second consecutive night of border tensions—including 35 over its capital region, as per an Associated Press report. Kyiv's air force also claims to have intercepted 128 drones from Moscow at around the same time.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said that it had shot down 105 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 35 over the Moscow region. It was the second straight night that Kyiv’s forces have targeted the Russian capital.\n\nThe European Union, along with the UK, has, however, ramped up sanctions on Russia in its 17th sanctions package, announced earlier this week.\n\nThe latest sanctions, finalised three months ago, will run parallel to Russian delays in agreeing to ceasefire negotiations, which, according to Trump, would be taking place with Putin and Zelenskyy meeting face-to-face at the Vatican.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had also spoken of a further package of sanctions being prepared, with inputs from Zelenskyy."

But after the phone call with Trump on Monday, Putin said that efforts were “generally on the right track”.\n\nIn a statement to media near the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Putin said “We have agreed with the president of the United States that Russia will propose and is ready to work with the Ukrainian side on a memorandum on a possible future peace accord,” Reuters reported.\n\n⚡️ President of Russia Vladimir Putin’s statement to the press following his phone conversation with @realDonaldTrump 💬 Russia supports a peaceful settlement of the Ukraine crisis.

Ukraine, its European allies and Trump-led United States have all urged Putin to agree to a 30-day unconditional and immediate ceasefire deal and pause the over three-year-long hostilities in the region.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n“I would like to note that, on the whole, Russia’s position is clear. The main thing for us is to eliminate the root causes of this crisis. We just need to determine the most effective ways to move towards peace,” Putin further added.\n\nAfter holding a two hour long call with Putin, US President Trump said Russia and Ukraine would begin negotiations for a ceasefire immediately. In a Truth Social post, Trump said the conversation with the Russian counterpart “went very well” and that talks for an immediate ceasefire and to end the three year long war would now begin. The US president further informed that he also held talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nPutin, who envisions the war with Ukraine as a watershed moment in Russia’s relation to the West, believes that the latter humiliated Moscow when the Soviet Union fell in 1991 and by enlarging NATO, the US-led alliance is encroaching on what Putin considers Moscow’s sphere of influence, including Ukraine.\n\nAccording to a Reuters report, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said that Putin and Trump didn’t discuss any specific timeline for the ceasefire proposal with Ukraine. But the two leaders discussed a possible prisoner swap, where it was proposed to trade nine Russians for nine Americans. The Kremlin aide added that Trump called the prospects for ties between Moscow and Washington “impressive.”"

It is clear that everyone wants to do this as quickly as possible, but, of course, the devil is in the details,” Peskov said, as reported by RIA state news agency.\n\nPeskov added that drafts of the memorandum to finalise a ceasefire and peace in the region would be written by both Russia and Ukraine and then these drafts would be exchanged. Thereafter, a complex negotiation would take place between Moscow and Kyiv to arrive at a unified text for the memorandum."

Expressing concern over people being killed in the war, he said 5,000 young soldiers are being killed every single week on average and it's a number probably worse than that, in addition to other people who are being killed in towns.\n\nCalling it an absolute bloodbath, he said he has seen satellite pictures that are so bad, so horrible.\n\n“My little conversation with a nice gentleman named Vladimir Putin. We had a good talk, and I think that progress is being made. 5,000 young soldiers are being killed every single week on average. And it's a number probably worse than that, in addition to other people that are being killed in towns. And we're trying to stop it. It's an absolute bloodbath. I've seen satellite pictures that are so bad, so horrible...We're doing the best we can. This was not our war. This was not me. We're doing something from the last administration. How did they allow that to happen? It wouldn't have happened,” Trump said,\n\nHe further added that Russia and Ukraine will \"immediately\" begin ceasefire negotiations. However, it was not clear when or where any talks might take place or who would participate.\n\nTrump's announcement came days after the first direct engagement between Russian and Ukrainian delegations since 2022. Those negotiations on Friday in Turkey brought about a limited exchange of prisoners but no pause in the fighting.\n\nAhead of the calls, the White House said Trump had grown \"frustrated\" with both leaders over the continuing war.\n\nVice President JD Vance said Trump would press Russian President Vladimir Putin to see if he was truly interested in stopping the fighting, and if not, that the US could disengage from trying to stop the conflict.\n\nTrump later told reporters that he believed Putin was serious about wanting peace. \"The conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of,\" Trump said in a social media post."

He informed them of the planned talks.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nTrump also said the Vatican could host the negotiations. “The Vatican, as represented by the Pope, has stated that it would be very interested in hosting the negotiations,” he said.\n\nAccording to Trump, Russia hopes for large-scale trade with the United States after the conflict ends. He said Ukraine would also benefit from trade “in the process of rebuilding its country.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Putin said Russia is ready to work with Ukraine on a memorandum for a possible peace deal. Speaking in Sochi, he said the document would outline principles for settlement and a possible timeline.\n\n“We have agreed with the president of the United States that Russia will propose and is ready to work with the Ukrainian side on a memorandum on a possible future peace accord,” Putin said.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nHe also stated that the talks were a step in the right direction and that any future ceasefire would depend on reaching suitable agreements.\n\n“If appropriate agreements are reached, then there could be a ceasefire,” Putin said. “The main thing for us is to eliminate the root causes of this crisis. We just need to determine the most effective ways to move towards peace.”\n\nTrump, who has long touted his deal-making abilities, has faced challenges delivering on his repeated claim that he could swiftly end the war. “He’s weary and frustrated with both sides,” Leavitt told reporters. Adding that he wants to see a peaceful resolution and ceasefire as soon as possible.”\n\nVice President JD Vance warned that Trump is “more than open” to abandoning his diplomatic efforts if Putin shows no genuine interest in a settlement. “We’re not going to spin our wheels here,” Vance said, emphasising that the US under Trump is looking for real outcomes.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nTrump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, expressed confidence in the former president’s personal rapport with Putin. He believes picking up the phone can break the logjam, Witkoff said. “I think it’s going to be a very successful call.”\n\nYet, concerns persist. Critics warn that Trump’s perceived affinity for Putin could undercut Ukraine. Former US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, who resigned last month, criticised the administration’s approach. The pressure was always on the victim, not the aggressor, she said, recalling a February Oval Office meeting where Zelenskyy was allegedly scolded for not being deferential enough. “I believe that peace at any price is not peace at all,” she said.\n\nTrump previously posted that his conversation with Putin would address ending the “bloodbath” and might include discussions on trade; a possible sign that economic incentives could play a role in any deal. His administration has floated the idea of rethinking sanctions if Russia engages in good faith.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent reinforced this message, saying on NBC’s Meet the Press that sanctions could intensify if Putin doesn’t come to the table. He also criticised prior sanctions under President Joe Biden as ineffective for failing to curb Russia’s oil revenues.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAlthough hopes for a ceasefire remain elusive, Ukraine and Russia have agreed to a significant prisoner exchange – 1,000 from each side – potentially taking place this week, according to Ukrainian intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov.\n\nPutin recently declined Zelenskyy’s offer for an in-person meeting in Turkey, instead opting to wait until Trump was directly involved. “He and I will meet, and I think we’ll solve it or maybe not,” Trump said Friday while departing the Middle East. “At least we’ll know.”\n\nZelenskyy, meanwhile, met with Vice President Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Rome on Sunday. He later posted on X that their talks covered sanctions, defence cooperation, battlefield updates, and the upcoming prisoner swap. “Pressure is needed against Russia until they are eager to stop the war,” he said.\n\nTrump also consulted with European leaders, including Germany’s Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron, ahead of his call with Putin. Macron later urged Putin to accept a proposed 30-day unconditional ceasefire backed by both Ukraine and Europe.\n\n(with inputs from agencies)"

        "full_content": "In an age when conflicts are dragging on and nations struggle to decide the correct time to terminate them, this military operation can serve as a template for others to follow in the future.\n\nLaunched to avenge the dastardly terror attack on innocent tourists in the popular destination of Pahalgam in Kashmir, the operation broke the back of terror in Pakistan. It delivered a blow from which Pakistan-based terror groups as well as the Pakistan military will take a long time to recover. More importantly, by agreeing to a ceasefire at Pakistan’s request just four days into the conflict, it is setting records as one of the shortest military engagements in the modern era.\n\nOperation Sindoor, a short, precise, and lethal military operation conducted by India, deep into Pakistan, has broken many glass ceilings and is setting benchmarks for the world to emulate.\n\nAlso Read: Op Sindoor: Inside story of what led Pakistan DGMO to make frantic calls for ‘ceasefire’\n\nWhat happened in Operation Sindoor\n\nOperation Sindoor was a three-night military operation from 7-10 May 2025. In the first phase, India launched coordinated air-launched missile and drone strikes against nine prominent terrorist locations in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), as well as deep inside Pakistan. These precision strikes were unprecedented in the history of the India–Pakistan conflict.\n\nThe fact that the strikes were delivered almost simultaneously over a frontage of hundreds of kilometres—stretching from Muzaffarabad in PoK to Bahawalpur in Pakistani Punjab—within a short span of about 30 minutes, left both the Pakistani state and the terror groups stunned, with no time to react. Also, the fact that four target locations were in Pakistan, across the international border, and included the headquarters of terror groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke, was unimaginable for the Pakistani military, adding to the shock and awe.\n\nOver the next two days, Pakistan tried to respond with waves of drone and missile strikes targeting India’s civilian and military infrastructure but was effectively thwarted by a well-integrated air defence system. In response, India took out Pakistan’s air defence systems and radars in prominent locations, including Lahore.\n\nOn the night of 9 May, India, exercising its right to respond, targeted 11 military airfields and other critical infrastructure in precision strikes across Pakistan, severely crippling its air power capability. Shocked and devastated by the damage inflicted, Pakistan was quick to request a ceasefire on 10 May, which India accepted.\n\nThe ceasefire ended the conflict, which is being termed by many commentators as one of the shortest and most effective military operations in modern history. A brief look at other recent conflicts in the world would give a better understanding and perhaps an appreciation of the military might and precision demonstrated by India in Operation Sindoor.\n\nWars that stretch on\n\nThe Gaza War, which commenced on 7 October 2023, triggered by a terror attack by Hamas into Israel, has been going on for over 20 months and shows no signs of ending. Reason? Despite a number of occasions when Israel was clearly ascendant and militarily dominant, it has not been able to call it off. To most military observers, it stems from two reasons. Firstly, the military objectives—which include ‘eliminating Hamas from the face of the Earth forever’—are deemed unrealistic and difficult to accomplish on the ground. Secondly, on several occasions, a lack of synergy and growing discontent between the military, intelligence, and political leadership has come to the fore, leading to confused decision-making and stretched timelines.\n\nThen there’s the Russia-Ukraine War, which broke out on 24 February 2022 after Russia launched ‘Special Military Operations’ against Ukraine. Despite initial claims that Russia would achieve its politico-military objectives in 20-30 days, the conflict continues even three years on with no immediate signs of resolution. Reason? Russia had three stated objectives: demilitarisation of Ukraine, denazification of Ukraine, and the declaration of independence of Russian-speaking areas, especially Donetsk and Luhansk. Although Russia has been dominant for the most part during these three years of conflict, the challenge has been to translate these objectives into clearly defined targets for the military to strike and capture. How does a military achieve the aim demilitarisation or denazification? Obviously, military support from Europe and the US has also contributed to the continuation of the conflict.\n\nWhen discussing long-drawn conflicts, the US-led war in Afghanistan cannot be left out. A war which began with targeting Al Qaeda bases to avenge the 9/11 terror attack soon morphed into a war against the Taliban, gradually moving into the space of political stabilisation and training Afghan military forces to defend themselves. Result? An unending campaign with no clearly defined objectives, which finally came to a close with the embarrassing overnight pullout of American forces in August 2021, leaving the Afghans at the mercy of the Taliban.\n\nMany other military campaigns ended a similar manner, like the war in Yemen, which went on for eight years, from March 2015 to March 2023, and still left the Houthis in charge.\n\nThe bottom line is that most countries have found it easy to get into a military conflict, but have not been able to devise a successful and effective exit strategy.\n\nLessons from Operation Sindoor\n\nOperation Sindoor avoided many of the pitfalls of other conflicts around the world.\n\nClearly defined military objectives. The operation was launched to target the terrorist outfits behind the Pahalgam attack. In striking nine locations in Pakistan, the Indian armed forces were precise in converting the military objective into action. The subsequent strikes on air defence targets and air bases in Pakistan were also based on clearly defined directions to strike back in response, and harder than the Pakistani effort. At no point did the military objectives stretch to include other possibilities like extending this operation to resolve territorial issues in PoK or Pakistan by undertaking ground operations or using naval forces for active kinetic action. This was a very important factor in enabling an early ceasefire.\n\nStrong and decisive political directives. In a country where terror strikes such as the Parliament attack in 2001 or 26/11 in Mumbai went unanswered, the scale, might, and depth of Operation Sindoor was an astonishing signal of political intent. The precise directive given to the armed forces, and the freedom to convert that political intent into military action, was a key factor in bringing down heavy punishment on terror groups and military infrastructure in Pakistan.\n\nSynergy and ‘whole of nation’ approach. Operation Sindoor was a textbook example of synergy between the Army, Navy, Air Force, and even the Border Security Force and other security and intelligence agencies. Selection of targets, timely corroboration of intelligence by multiple sources, evacuation of citizens in Indian border areas to safer places, and vigilance to ensure that communal harmony within the country was not disturbed—all were conducted with great synergy and inter-agency coordination, leading to speedy achievement of military objectives with minimum losses.\n\nSelection and maintenance of aim (target). By carefully selecting the nine locations critical to terror infrastructure in Pakistan on 7 May, the air defence systems on 8 May, and thereafter the 11 air bases on 9 May, the Indian armed forces displayed exceptional focus in applying a very important principle of war: ‘selection and maintenance of aim’. This was also a major contributory factor in the early declaration of ceasefire.\n\nNon-escalatory nature of operations. Right from the outset, India maintained a clear position that the objective was to target terror infrastructure, and that Pakistani military or civilian infrastructure was not a part of the war objectives. This was reiterated even after the strikes on Pakistan air defences and air bases, making it easier for India to accept Pakistan’s plea for an early ceasefire.\n\nKeeping the operations below the nuclear threshold. India kept the threat of Pakistan using nuclear weapons in mind while planning and executing operations. By not targeting any civilian areas or key civilian or military infrastructure (except air bases, that too in response to Pakistani air raids), and by not launching ground incursions deep into Pakistani territory or a naval blockade, India did not let Pakistan play victim or find grounds to explore the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nAlso Read: This is the new India—we don’t return to business as usual after terror attacks\n\nOne for the history books\n\nOperation Sindoor was not only a successful military operation but has set many benchmarks for the world to follow. Among post–World War 2 conflicts, only the Six-Day War of June 1967, fought between Israel and the Arab countries, comes close to such a bold, decisive, and swift military campaign.\n\nTherefore, Operation Sindoor will be studied, analysed, and remembered not only for its military precision and strong political intent but also for ending quickly, from a position of huge military and political advantage. It will definitely be remembered as a major turning point in India’s fight against terror and as a display of India’s military prowess and professionalism.\n\nCol Rajeev Agarwal is a Senior Research Consultant at Chintan Research Foundation.

They were held in Turkey, where a prisoner exchange was agreed but no progress made on securing a ceasefire.\"We discussed the talks in Istanbul, where the Russians sent a low-level delegation with no decision-making powers,\" Zelensky wrote on Telegram following the meeting with Vance at the US ambassador's residence in Rome.Both men had earlier attended Pope Leo's inaugural mass at the Vatican.\"We also touched on the need for sanctions against Russia, bilateral trade, defence cooperation, the situation on the battlefield and the future exchange of prisoners,\" Zelensky added.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Zelensky's aide Andriy Yermak were also present.In a short statement, the White House said \"the leaders discussed their shared goal of ending the bloodshed in Ukraine and provided updates on the current state of negotiations for a ceasefire and lasting peace.\"A photo accompanying the statement showed Vance and Zelensky with broad smiles, a sharp contrast to their bitter February clash in the Oval Office.Vance also held a meeting with the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Italy's Prime Minister Georgia Meloni that the White House later described as \"constructive.\"A senior Ukrainian official from the president's office, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told AFP that Zelensky and Vance discussed preparations for Monday's telephone conversation between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on Saturday that he would speak by phone with Putin on Monday in order to stop the \"BLOODBATH\" in Ukraine.The leaders of Britain, Germany and France also want to talk to Trump ahead of that call with Putin, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said.The US president has increased pressure on Ukraine and so far abstained from criticising Putin, who started the biggest conflict in Europe since World War Two.'Better' talks==================The official said that the Rome encounter went \"better\" than the Oval Office row three months ago.Then, Vance publically accused Zelensky of being \"disrespectful\" towards Trump, who told the Ukrainian leader he should be more grateful and that he had no \"cards\" to play in negotiations with Russia.Zelensky and his wife Olena Zelenska were earlier granted an audience with Leo following his inauguration.\"We thank the Vatican for its willingness to become a platform for direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia,\" Ukraine's leader said after meeting the pontiff.\"The martyred Ukraine is waiting for negotiations for a just and lasting peace to finally happen,\" Leo XIV said during his inauguration.'Record' drone barrage===========================Ukraine on Sunday said that Russia had launched a record number of drones at the country overnight, targeting various regions, including the capital Kyiv, where a woman was killed.Another man was killed in the southeastern Kherson region, where a railway station and private houses and cars were hit.The Ukrainian air force said that Russia had launched \"273 Shahed attack drones and various types of imitator drones\", of which 88 were destroyed and 128 more went astray \"without negative consequences\".Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said it was a \"record\" number of drones. \"Russia has a clear goal -- to continue killing civilians,\" she said.The Russian military said it had intercepted 25 Ukrainian drones overnight and on Sunday morning. Moscow also claimed it had captured Bahatyr, another village in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region, as it intensifies the war effort despite the Istanbul peace talks.'Root causes'=================In an interview with Russian state TV published on Sunday, Putin said that Moscow's aim was to \"eliminate the causes that triggered this crisis, create the conditions for a lasting peace and guarantee Russia's security\", without elaborating further.Russia's references to the \"root causes\" of the conflict typically refer to alleged grievances with Kyiv and the West that Moscow has put forward as justification for launching the invasion in February 2022.They include pledges to \"de-Nazify\" and demilitarise Ukraine, protect Russian speakers in the country's east, push back against NATO expansion and stop Ukraine's westward geopolitical drift.Kyiv and the West say that Russia's invasion is nothing more than an imperial-style land grab.Tens of thousands have been killed since Russia started the war, with millions forced to flee their homes.Friday's talks in Turkey led to an agreement to exchange 1,000 prisoners each."

        "full_content": "After all the speculation about how Russian President Vladimir Putin would respond to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s offer to meet for peace talks in Istanbul, it isn’t surprising that Mr. Putin declined. Instead he sent a low-level delegation, headed by the ultraconservative former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky.\n\nHaving repeatedly declared Mr. Zelensky’s government illegitimate, Mr. Putin would have made a huge concession—and appeared weak—if he had met with Mr. Zelensky. More important, a meeting between the two, which President Trump had suggested he might attend as well, wouldn’t have achieved much. Mr. Putin relishes being a wartime leader and is determined to continue the conflict until Ukraine is coerced into becoming a “friendly\" neighbor.\n\nIn keeping with Mr. Trump’s stance that Russia isn’t the aggressor in the Ukraine war, a White House proposal to end the conflict, crafted last month, made major concessions to the Kremlin, legitimizing Russia’s occupation of Crimea and granting Russia all the territory it has gained since the war began. The plan also proposed a gradual lifting of the economic sanctions against Russia that were imposed in 2014, as well as a promise that Ukraine won’t join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. When Mr. Zelensky rejected the deal, Mr. Trump accused him of being “inflammatory\" and suggested that he—not Mr. Putin—was the problem.\n\nMr. Trump began to change his tune after Russia’s deadly April 24 missile and drone attack on Kyiv, saying the strikes were unnecessary and “very bad timing.\" Then, following a meeting with Mr. Zelensky before the funeral of Pope Francis, Mr. Trump questioned Mr. Putin’s interest in a peace deal and raised the possibility of new sanctions against Russia. He also said Russia had stolen Crimea from Ukraine. The sudden signing of an economic partnership agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine, announced April 30, further suggested that Mr. Trump was shifting to a more favorable stance toward Ukraine as he grew frustrated with Russia’s response to peace proposals.\n\nMeanwhile, top officials in Mr. Putin’s government began talking tough. On April 24 the head of Russia’s security council, former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, addressed proposals for a Western peacekeeping contingent in Ukraine to monitor compliance with a future cease-fire. Stating that Russia had invaded Ukraine because of the threat of NATO military deployment in Russia’s “historical territory\" inside Ukraine, Mr. Shoigu said that the introduction of foreign troops in Ukraine could lead to a direct military conflict between Russia and NATO countries.\n\nIn an interview with the Russian news agency TASS on April 29, Mr. Shoigu’s predecessor and Putin ally Nikolai Patrushev, now an adviser to the Russian president, claimed that NATO was conducting naval exercises with nuclear-armed submarines and working out scenarios for a “nuclear apocalypse\" with strikes on Russian bases that house nuclear weapons. In an April 28 interview Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov laid out Russia’s maximalist demands for peace negotiations that went well beyond those in the Trump proposal.\n\nAgainst this backdrop Mr. Putin made an offer for Ukrainian and Russian negotiators to meet directly in Istanbul, without accepting a proposal for a 30-day truce supported by Ukraine, the U.S. and the European members of NATO as a precondition for further peace talks. Mr. Trump jumped on Mr. Putin’s proposal, leaving the Europeans and Ukrainians at a loss. Mr. Zelensky took a gamble and not only agreed but said he would attend, putting Mr. Putin in a difficult position.\n\nThe day before the talks began, Mr. Putin and his top security and defense team met with Mr. Medinsky to prepare for the negotiations. If these men were concerned that Mr. Putin’s absence would reinforce Mr. Trump’s doubts about their leader’s intentions for peace, they were probably reassured by Mr. Trump’s subsequent statement: “Nothing’s going to happen until Putin and I get together\"—suggesting that the two can still reach a peace deal without including Mr. Zelensky.\n\nMr. Trump apparently doesn’t understand that Mr. Putin isn’t ready to end hostilities. He said on Fox News Friday that “Putin is tired of the war.\" But, as Russian commentator Maksim Katz pointed out on May 13, Mr. Putin seems to enjoy the conflict: “Putin blossoms whenever he talks about war. Instead of an aging dictator, he appears as a military leader, a character in some exciting movie that is playing in real time 3D right around him.\"\n\nHaving rallied his people to support a patriotic struggle against Western enemies and fueled Russia’s economic growth with massive military spending, Mr. Putin wants Mr. Trump to cut off arms deliveries and crucial intelligence to Ukraine so that Russian troops can move beyond their snail’s-pace offensive and gain substantial swaths of Ukrainian territory. With this goal in mind, Mr. Putin is going along with the negotiations in the hope that Mr. Trump eventually will give up on a peace settlement and walk away from the conflict altogether.\n\nAs expected, Friday’s talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations failed to make progress because the Russians put forth their usual maximalist demands. The next day Mr. Trump announced that he will be talking by phone with Mr. Putin on Monday, and plans to call Mr. Zelensky after. Mr. Trump should make clear to Mr. Putin that if Russia doesn’t agree to a 30-day cease-fire and back off from its demands, the U.S. will keep providing Ukraine with the military aid necessary to defend itself against Russian aggression.\n\nMs. Knight is author, most recently, of “The Kremlin’s Noose: Putin’s Bitter Feud With the Oligarch Who Made Him Ruler of Russia.\""

The EU has estimated that $221.5 billion out of approximately $300 billion worth of frozen Russian assets are held in the 27-nation bloc, primarily in the form of government bonds that the Bank of Russia, the nation's central bank, had stored as reserves, a Reuters report said.\n\nThe EU has also said that it expected these assets were capable of yielding about $16-$22 billion in interest earned by 2027 as well, subject to fluctuations in euro zone rates, a related report said.\n\nALSO READ | 'Stop the bloodbath': Trump to call Putin, Zelenskyy, NATO leaders in fresh push for ceasefire\n\n“We were able to negotiate additional funding for Finland’s support for Ukraine ... The products are purchased from Finnish industry to boost employment at home and sent to Ukraine to help its defence. I am very pleased with the outcome,” the Minister of Defence Antti Häkkänen explained, in the press release.\n\nAlthough Russia has not properly responded to this, the utilisation of their own frozen assets, especially to aid Ukraine, is highly likely to incur legal and geopolitical trouble.\n\nReiterating Finland's “strong and unwavering” support for Ukraine, Häkkänen explained that the EU-sourced munitions package would be accompanied by a Finnish support programme worth €660 million ($741.6 million) to support, and “forge closer links between the Finnish industry and Finland's support” for the embattled nation.\n\n“This is a great example of the Finnish defence industry’s abilities, and it shows that our investments into ammunition production capacity are paying off,” Häkkänen concluded."

We hope that we will be treated in the same way,” Putin said, expressing readiness to consider US interests.\n\nThree rounds of talks between Putin and US President’s Special Envoy Steve Witkoff reportedly brought some convergence on the status of Crimea and Russian-occupied territories, and Ukraine’s NATO neutrality. However, key sticking points remain over Ukraine’s demilitarisation and the possible deployment of foreign troops as a “reassurance force.”\n\nDelegations from Ukraine and Russia met in Turkey on Thursday for the first direct talks related to ending the war Russia started in February 2022 when it launched a full-scale invasion of its sovereign neighbour.\n\nHowever, Trump, who cast doubt on the effectiveness of the Istanbul meeting, declaring that “nothing could happen” until he personally meets Putin, announced Saturday that he will speak with Putin over the phone on Monday at 10 am ET. The president said he planned to speak with Zelenskyy and “various” NATO allies after his call with Putin."

Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov told the state TASS news agency the call was ‘being prepared’ read more\n\nThis combination of pictures created on March 18, 2025 shows President Donald Trump (L) on the phone on January 28, 2017 in Washington, and Russia's President Vladimir Putin (R) on the phone Moscow on December 27, 2023. AFP\n\nUS President Donald Trump said Saturday he would speak by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the “bloodbath” in Ukraine, a day after the first direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in more than three years.\n\nTrump, who has been pressing Russia to agree a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, said he would speak with him by phone on Monday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov told the state TASS news agency the call was “being prepared”.\n\nEarlier Saturday, the Kremlin had said that a meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would be possible only after both sides reach an agreement.\n\nThat came a day after direct talks between the two countries led to an agreement for another exchange of prisoners.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nEarly Saturday, a Russian drone attack on a minibus carrying evacuated civilians in Ukraine’s eastern Sumy region killed nine people and wounded five, local authorities said.\n\nZelenskyy, denouncing the attack and Russia’s refusal so far to agree a ceasefire, repeated his call for fresh sanctions against Moscow.\n\n“Without stronger sanctions, without stronger pressure on Russia, there will be no real diplomacy there,” he insisted.\n\nOn Friday in Istanbul, the first direct Ukraine-Russia talks since the spring of 2022 – shortly after Moscow’s full-scale invasion that February – led to an agreement to exchange 1,000 prisoners each.\n\nUkraine’s top negotiator, Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, said the “next step” would be a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin.\n\nRussia said it had taken note of the request.\n\n“We consider it possible, but only as a result of the work and upon achieving certain results in the form of an agreement between the two sides,” the Kremlin’s spokesman said.\n\nTrump denounces ‘bloodbath’\n\nRussia’s top negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said Moscow and Kyiv would “present their vision of a possible future ceasefire”, without saying when.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThe Kremlin said that first the POW swap had to be completed and both sides need to present their visions for a ceasefire before fixing the next round of talks.\n\n“For now, we need to do what the delegations agreed on yesterday” in Turkey, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, which meant “first and foremost to complete a 1,000 for 1,000 swap”.\n\nThe head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, Kirillo Budanov, told broadcaster TSN he hoped the exchange would happen next week.\n\nPosting on Truth Social Saturday, Trump said he would speak to Putin on Monday to discuss finding a way out of the “BLOODBATH”.\n\nAfterwards, he added, he would speak to Zelenskyy and Nato officials, expressing hope that a “ceasefire will take place, and this very violent war… will end”.\n\nBoth Moscow and Washington have already stressed the need for a meeting on the conflict between Putin and Trump.\n\nTrump has argued that “nothing’s going to happen” on the conflict until he meets Putin face-to-face.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio welcomed the latest prisoner exchange in a telephone call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.\n\nAnd in an interview with CBS, he said Lavrov had told him Moscow was preparing a document outlining its requirements for a ceasefire.\n\nIf Russia and Moscow can both provide “serious and viable” proposals “then there’s been real progress, and we can work off of that,” Rubio said.\n\nFighting goes on\n\nThe attack on the bus happened near the city of Bilopillya, local community head Yuri Zarko told Suspilne TV. A family of three were among the dead, the authorities said.Elsewhere on the frontlines, the Russian army said its troops captured Oleksandropil village in the eastern Donetsk region, site of some of the most intense fighting.\n\nAs well as Sumy, Russia also pounded eastern Ukraine with missiles and drones, killing six and wounding more than a dozen, officials said. In Kherson, Russian shelling hit a truck carrying humanitarian aid Saturday morning.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nZelenskyy accused Putin of being “afraid” after he declined to Travel to Turkey for talks and argued that Russia was not taking the talks seriously.\n\n“Yesterday in Istanbul, everyone saw a weak and unprepared Russian delegation with no significant powers. This must change. We need real steps to end the war,” Zelenskyy said Saturday.\n\nOn Friday, Zelenskyy had called for a “strong reaction” from the world, including new sanctions, if the Istanbul talks failed.\n\nMacron said European nations were coordinating with Washington on additional sanctions should Moscow continue to refuse an “unconditional ceasefire.”\n\nOn Saturday, Zelenskyy said he had spoken to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney about fresh and effective sanctions against Russia.\n\nDuring the Istanbul talks, the Ukrainian side said Russia had made “unacceptable” territorial demands.\n\nMoscow claims annexation of five Ukrainian regions – four since its 2022 invasion, and Crimea, which it annexed in 2014."

        "full_content": "The first high level talks between Russia and Ukraine since the early months of Moscow’s 2022 attack showed they are far from agreement on steps needed for a ceasefire, even though they promised a major swap of prisoners of war. read more\n\nThe first high-level talks between Russia and Ukraine since the early stages of Moscow’s 2022 attack have concluded with a stark reminder of the immense gulf separating the two nations, offering scant optimism for an imminent ceasefire. Despite promises of a major prisoner swap, the talks revealed a profound lack of common ground on the fundamental steps required to stop the ongoing conflict.\n\nDespite the palpable distance in their positions, a sliver of diplomatic possibility remains. Turkey, the host nation said that both Russia and Ukraine had agreed in principle to hold further negotiations. The statement offers a glimmer of hope for US President Donald Trump, who has called for a swift peace agreement.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nPeter Slezkine, senior fellow and director of the Russia program at the Stimson Center, described the talks as “substantial steps.” He said, “I do think that they are a very hopeful sign, because the two sides coming into direct contact is an important development.”\n\nHowever, the initial optimism generated by the meeting quickly faded upon closer examination of the stated positions. Ukraine, backed by the United States and other Western allies, has consistently called for a 30-day ceasefire without any preconditions to facilitate meaningful peace negotiations.\n\nIn stark contrast, Russia, which currently occupies nearly a fifth of Ukrainian territory, displayed minimal inclination towards compromise. Moscow reiterated its maximalist demands, insisting on Ukraine’s withdrawal from and recognition of Russia’s claim over four Ukrainian regions – territories the Kremlin unilaterally annexed but does not fully control.\n\nThe carefully worded statements released by both sides following the Istanbul talks did little to conceal the deep chasm that persists between them. A Ukrainian diplomatic source, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the discussions, revealed that Russia presented demands that were “detached from reality and go far beyond anything that was previously discussed.” These reportedly included ultimatums for Ukrainian forces to withdraw from sovereign Ukrainian land, alongside “other nonstarters and non-constructive conditions.”\n\nAdding a chilling perspective, the Kremlin’s chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, suggested that Russia was prepared to continue its military campaign for as long as necessary to achieve its objectives. Drawing a historical parallel to Russia’s protracted 18th-century war against Sweden, he argued that Kyiv’s resistance to Russia’s “peace demands” was only hastening its own demise.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nA senior Ukrainian government official with direct knowledge of the abortive 2022 peace talks with Russia expressed little surprise at the outcome in Istanbul, telling Reuters that it unfolded “entirely as expected.” The source offered a more pragmatic, if less hopeful, view: “‘Every journey begins with a single step. This is the beginning of the journey. Demands are always exaggerated at the start of any negotiations. That’s classic.’”\n\nThe fragile outcome places renewed emphasis on President Trump’s role. Just before the talks, Trump abruptly shifted stance, saying he needed a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to achieve a breakthrough. This move temporarily undercut European efforts to pressure Washington into imposing tougher sanctions on Russia.\n\nEarlier in the week, leaders of four major European powers had visited Kyiv, warning Russia of fresh sanctions if it failed to agree to a 30-day ceasefire by May 12, a position supported by the US However, when Putin proposed talks instead of a ceasefire, Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on social media to accept the proposal immediately, without mentioning impending sanctions.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nZelenskyy, wary of alienating the influential US President, publicly supported direct talks with Putin. The Kremlin’s response was to dispatch a delegation for the Istanbul talks that conspicuously excluded Putin himself, as well as any high-ranking ministers.\n\nRussian political analyst Vladimir Pastukhov wryly commented on the appointment of Medinsky, a figure from the failed 2022 talks, as delegation head, saying, “You don’t send undertakers to a wedding.”\n\nAfter the Istanbul talks, Trump and the leaders of the four European powers spoke again with Zelenskyy to discuss the way forward. Publicly, the Ukrainian team renewed calls for direct negotiations between Zelenskyy and Putin, arguing only the Russian president has the authority to resolve key issues.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News, Trump expressed optimism about reaching an agreement but added that he would impose sanctions on Russia if no deal could be made.\n\nWhile the talks represent a diplomatic step forward, the entrenched positions and expansive Russian demands suggest that a genuine ceasefire remains elusive for now, raising questions over whether the negotiations mark the beginning of peace or merely a strategic ploy in a protracted conflict.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD"

        "full_content": "The first direct Russia-Ukraine peace talks since the early weeks of Moscow’s 2022 invasion ended after less than two hours Friday, and while both sides agreed on a large prisoner swap, they clearly remained far apart on key conditions for ending the fighting. read more\n\nThis handout photograph taken and released by Turkish Foreign Ministry on May 16, 2025, shows Turkey's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan (C), Turkish Intelligence Organization Director Ibrahim Kalin (2nd L), attending a meeting for Ukraine-Russia peace talks at the Turkish Presidential office Dolmabahce, in Istanbul. Image- AFP\n\nThe first face-to-face talks between Ukraine and Russia in over three years ended Friday without a ceasefire agreement, with Kyiv dismissing Moscow’s conditions as “non-starters” while both sides agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war – the largest such swap since the war began.\n\nThe meeting, held in Istanbul’s Dolmabahce Palace, lasted less than two hours. Although the two sides agreed in principle to swap 1,000 prisoners of war each — the largest such exchange to date — the broader goal of peace remained elusive.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nRussia reportedly introduced new and “unacceptable” demands, including the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from large territories, according to a senior Ukrainian official speaking on condition of anonymity. These terms, never previously discussed, were rejected outright by Kyiv. “Russia’s demands were detached from reality,” said a source in Ukraine’s delegation.\n\nDivergent Red Lines\n\nRussia expressed satisfaction with the talks and readiness for further contacts, but Ukrainian officials revealed Moscow had introduced unexpected conditions, including Ukrainian troop withdrawals from large occupied areas. “These proposals had never been discussed before,” a senior Ukrainian official told The Associated Press anonymously.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi confirmed Russia made “unacceptable” demands but said Kyiv’s delegation maintained its stance calmly. The Ukrainian side reiterated its focus on achieving an immediate truce and a diplomatic roadmap aligned with US and European proposals.\n\nThe Trump Factor\n\nUS President Donald Trump, who has pressured both sides to end Europe’s bloodiest conflict since WWII, said negotiations wouldn’t progress until he meets Vladimir Putin. “Nothing’s going to happen until Putin and I get together,” Trump told reporters in Abu Dhabi. Putin notably skipped the Istanbul talks, prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also absent to deride Russia’s delegation as “dummies.”\n\nZelenskyy immediately rallied Western allies post-talks, urging tougher sanctions if Moscow rejects a 30-day ceasefire proposal. He held calls with Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and Polish leader Donald Tusk.\n\nA Theater of Diplomacy?\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan opened the talks, urging participants to seize the opportunity for peace, calling a ceasefire “critically important.” While both sides agreed in principle to meet again, the day’s events suggested the negotiations served more as a stage for grievances than a pathway to peace.\n\nRussia’s lead negotiator Vladimir Medinsky had earlier said readiness for “possible compromises,” without details. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy’s team emphasised they would only engage in top-level talks with Putin present – a condition the Kremlin continues to ignore.\n\nWith the prisoner swap as the sole concrete outcome, the Istanbul meeting highlighted how far apart the two nations remain after 27 months of war. As Ukraine pushes for Western-backed solutions and Russia floats unspecified compromises, the talks appeared less about making peace than managing its impossibility."

        "full_content": "A succession of similar scenes, in which the protagonist is seen waiting in a hard, straight-backed chair, in dreary brown rooms ruled over by dreary brown bureaucrats, is amongst the most telling leitmotifs of Sergei Lozintsa’s Cannes competition entry Two Prosecutors.\n\nYou can wait all you want, but in the end, Godot will keep you waiting.\n\nThe film is set in 1938, “at the height of Stalinist terror,” and is about a newly-appointed idealistic prosecutor who receives a prisoner’s letter written in blood, protesting his innocence. From then on, we see Kornev (Alexander Kuznetsov) attempting in all earnestness to try and meet the prisoner, who is at first only a number in a cell. The bloody weals on his body shock the young law graduate, and he sets out to meet the senior prosecutor, in the hope that the latter’s intervention will help rectify matters.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nLoznitsa is in familiar territory, having given us glimpses into the labyrinthine workings of Russia and his native Ukraine in his earlier work.\n\n‘Two Prosectors’ doesn’t deviate from bleakness, but is possibly his most accessible film in the manner in which he depicts a system, locked and loaded against the less powerful. If you are below in the pecking order, there you will remain, so do not go about getting ideas above your station.\n\nThe tussle between the two prosecutors, on either side of the spectrum, one just beginning his journey, the other on top, could well have been the subject of a Kafka novel.\n\nNothing is stated. Open hostility can be combated, but there’s nothing you can do with a perfectly calibrated official disdain that keeps you waiting endlessly, without granting you a meeting.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAdapted from political activist and gulag survivor Georgy Demidov’s 1969 book, the brooding, atmospheric ‘Two Prosecutors’ will put you in mind of Kafka and Solzhenitsyn, and so many others who wrote movingly about a ruthless regime where human rights were turned into a joke. When Kornev requests a meeting with the prison warden, the guard can’t believe it, and when he informs the man guarding a higher gate, they both burst out laughing. Some random person asking to be let into their sanctum, where they are the masters of the skeletal inmates who keep dropping dead of overwork? Preposterous.\n\nThe thing with Kornev is that he just doesn’t learn. He does, finally, get to meet with the USSR’s top prosecutor (Vytautas Kaniuonis). But the reception is cold, and as he recounts the story of the prisoner and his quest, it gets colder still, and the consequence is chilling.\n\nWhat makes the well-performed ‘Two Prosecutors’ such a compelling watch is that it may speak of a bygone era, but with rising authoritarianism in so many parts of the world, it feels even more sharply relevant.\n\nAbsolute power corrupts absolutely. ‘Dossier 137’, a police procedural deftly directed by Dominik Moll, has a thematic similarity with ‘Two Prosecutors’ in the way it shows how traditional power structures are kept in place by every single stakeholder. Those who rock the boat are considered trouble-mongers, not the actual perpetrators themselves.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe French movie, also in competition, unfolds as a series of interrogations interspersed with bursts of action in Paris and the countryside. When a young man is shot and badly injured during a demonstration that turns violent, conscientious police officer Stephanie ( Lea Drucker) starts to investigate. She finds many troubling facts and a cover-up: as it is, she is part of a much-reviled group tasked to keep an eye on internal affairs, and in this instance, she finds, through a video of the incident, that her colleagues were directly involved.\n\nWhat follows is hard to watch as the complicit cops show that they are masters at deflection and active lying. Stephanie’s superior takes her up on a fact she believes the former kept deliberately hidden: that she belongs to the same town as the victim, and that that makes her biased. Racism is at work here too, in the shape of a black cleaner who displays the weary cynicism of the oppressed. When you know you aren’t going to win, what’s the point of making a noise and calling attention to yourself?\n\nMay as well watch cat videos, the way an old lady does in the movie, to keep the darkness at bay."

AP File\n\nRussia and Ukraine agreed a large-scale prisoner exchange, said they would trade ideas on a possible ceasefire and discussed a potential meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin in their first direct talks in over three years on Friday.\n\nBut coming out of the highly anticipated talks in Istanbul, which lasted just over 90 minutes, there were few signs of more significant progress toward ending the three-year war.\n\nKyiv was seeking an “unconditional ceasefire” to pause a conflict that has destroyed large swathes of Ukraine and displaced millions of people.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nMoscow has consistently rebuffed those calls, and the only concrete agreement appeared to be a deal to exchange 1,000 prisoners each.\n\nThe two sides said they would “present their vision of a possible future ceasefire”, according to Russia’s top negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky.\n\nThey did not agree any suspension to the fighting.\n\nRussia said it had also taken note of Ukraine’s request for a meeting of Presidents Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy.\n\n“Overall, we are satisfied with the results and ready to continue contacts,” Medinsky said.\n\nUkraine’s top negotiator, Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, said the “next step” would be a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy.\n\n“We understand that if we want to make progress, we need to have this meeting of leaders,” Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Georgiy Tykhy later said, praising the prisoner swap as a “great result”.\n\nPutin ‘afraid’\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, who presided over the meeting, said the sides had “agreed in principle to meet again” and would present ceasefire ideas “in writing”.\n\nFidan sat at the head of a table in front of Turkish, Russian and Ukrainian flags at Istanbul’s Dolmabahce Palace for the talks - with Russian and Ukrainian delegations facing each other, footage from the room showed.\n\nBut progress on more fundamental issues appeared minimal.\n\nTykhy said Russia had raised a number of “unacceptable demands”, with a source telling AFP that Russia had demanded Kyiv give up more territory - a strategy it said was designed to derail the negotiations.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nNevertheless, the fact the meeting took place at all was a sign of movement, with both sides having come under steady pressure from Washington to open talks.\n\nPutin declined to travel to Turkey for the meeting, sending a second-tier team instead.\n\nZelensky said Putin was “afraid” of meeting, and criticised Russia for not taking the talks “seriously”.\n\nSpeaking at a European summit in Albania, the Ukrainian leader urged a “strong reaction” from the world if the talks failed, including new sanctions.\n\nThe two sides spent 24 hours slinging insults at each other before the meeting, with Zelensky accusing Moscow of sending “empty heads” to the negotiating table.\n\nBoth Moscow and Washington have also talked up the need for a meeting between Putin and US President Donald Trump on the conflict.\n\nThe leaders of Ukraine, France, Germany, Britain and Poland held a phone call with Trump on Friday, Zelensky’s spokesperson said, without elaborating.\n\nTrump has said “nothing’s going to happen” on the conflict until he meets Putin face-to-face.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\n‘Unacceptable demands’\n\nAhead of the talks, Ukrainian officials in Istanbul held meetings with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump’s special envoy Keith Kellogg and the national security advisors of Britain, France and Germany.\n\nRubio urged a “peaceful” end to the war and said “the killing needs to stop”, according to State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce.\n\nWhile the talks were ongoing, a Ukrainian source told AFP that Russia was advancing hardline territorial demands.\n\nMoscow claims annexation of five Ukrainian regions – four since its 2022 invasion, and Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.\n\n“Russian representatives are putting forward unacceptable demands… such as for Ukraine to withdraw forces from large parts of Ukrainian territory it controls in order for a ceasefire to begin,” the source said.\n\nThey accused Moscow of seeking to “throw non-starters” so the talks end “without any results”.\n\nAnother source familiar with the talks said Russia had threatened to capture Ukraine’s Sumy and Kharkiv regions.\n\nBoth regions border Russia and were invaded by Moscow’s army at the start of the conflict, though Russia has not previously made formal territorial claims over them.\n\nRussia has repeatedly said it will not discuss giving up any territory that its forces occupy, and Putin last year called for Kyiv to withdraw from parts of the Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions that it still controls.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD"

This shift comes as Syria’s new leadership builds stronger ties with Gulf Arab and Western countries following the easing of some sanctions.\n\nSyrian officials are in talks with Oumolat, a UAE-based company, to produce the newly designed banknotes. Two Syrian financial sources confirmed to Reuters that the central bank governor and finance minister visited the firm in the UAE earlier this month.\n\n“The discussions with Oumolat are at an advanced stage,” one Syrian source said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAlso read | Trump announces end to US sanctions on Syria\n\nThe move marks a break from Russia, which had printed Syrian money throughout the 13-year conflict. Russia took over after European Union sanctions halted Syria’s contract with a European printer. Despite the planned shift, Damascus continues to receive Russian financial and material support, including cash, wheat and fuel, as Moscow maintains its military presence in Syria.\n\nOne European official told Reuters that two German companies, the state-backed Bundesdruckerei and private firm Giesecke+Devrient, had shown interest in printing Syrian currency. However, a spokesperson for Bundesdruckerei said the company was “not in talks for a currency-printing deal with the Syrian state,” while Giesecke+Devrient declined to comment.\n\nOfficials from the UAE foreign ministry, the German government and Syria’s central bank did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe redesigned notes will no longer feature Bashar al-Assad’s image, according to the three sources. A purple note with his portrait is currently still in use.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe currency shift reflects broader changes in Syria’s international relationships. On Thursday, Syria signed an $800 million preliminary agreement with the UAE’s DP World to develop the port of Tartus. This is the first major foreign deal announced since the United States said earlier this week it would lift sanctions on Syria’s economy.\n\nIn February, the European Union also suspended some of its financial sanctions on Syria, including measures that had prevented the country from printing currency through European firms.\n\nSyria’s economy remains fragile, worsened by a shortage of physical cash. Officials say people are hoarding banknotes, while bankers suggest authorities are limiting circulation to manage the exchange rate. As a result, banks often reject depositors and businesses who try to withdraw money.\n\nThe Syrian pound, which traded at 50 per US dollar before the war in 2011, was valued at about 10,000 per dollar on the black market on Friday. That’s an improvement from earlier this year, when it was around 15,000.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nWhile the new Syrian leadership is trying to reform the economy and rebuild external relations, its links to Russia remain a point of concern for some European states, especially in light of the war in Ukraine."

        "full_content": "ANKARA, Turkey : Russia and Ukraine are set to hold their first direct peace talks in three years, both countries said Thursday, but hopes for a breakthrough remained dim after Russian President Vladimir Putin spurned an offer by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to meet face-to-face in Turkey.\n\nZelenskyy said he is sending a team headed by his defense minister from the Turkish capital Ankara to Istanbul to meet a Russian delegation, even though Moscow's side doesn’t include “anyone who actually makes decisions.”\n\nThe Ukrainian side would be headed by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and its aim is “to attempt at least the first steps toward de-escalation, the first steps toward ending the war — namely, a ceasefire,” he said.\n\nFew had expected Putin to show up in Turkey, and his absence punctured any hope of significant progress toward ending the 3-year-old war amid peace efforts in recent months by the Trump administration and Western European leaders. It also raised the prospect of intensified international sanctions on Russia that have been threatened by the West.\n\nZelenskyy, who flew Thursday to Ankara after challenging Putin to sit down with him, accused Moscow of not making a serious effort to end the war by sending a low-level negotiating team that he described as “a theater prop.”\n\nHis proposal to Putin came amid a flurry of maneuvering last weekend as each side sought a diplomatic advantage.\n\nZelenskyy said he decided to send the delegation to Istanbul to demonstrate to U.S. President Donald Trump that Ukraine wants to end the fighting.\n\nThe war has killed tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides and more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians, according to the U.N. Russian forces are preparing a fresh military offensive , Ukrainian government and Western military analysts say.\n\nAt least five civilians were killed and 29 wounded in the past day, according to authorities in five eastern regions of Ukraine where Russia is trying to advance.\n\nThe head of the Russian delegation, presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, said in Istanbul that the representatives were ready to meet Ukrainian officials.\n\n“The task of these direct negotiations with Ukraine is to establish long-term peace sooner or later by eliminating the root causes of this conflict,” he said in a brief statement.\n\nIt was not clear when they would meet. The Russian state news agency Tass reported that the talks will go ahead Friday, citing an unidentified source.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he would confer Friday in Istanbul with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and the Ukrainian delegation, adding that the Russian delegation would be meeting with other members of the U.S. team and that he hoped all sides could get together.\n\n“We don’t have high expectations of what will happen tomorrow. And frankly, at this point, I think it’s abundantly clear that the only way we’re going to have a breakthrough here is between President Trump and President Putin,” Rubio told reporters in Antalya, Turkey, where he was attending a NATO foreign ministers meeting .\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier welcomed Zelenskyy to the presidential palace in Ankara for their own talks. Zelenskyy heads Friday to Albania for a gathering of European officials.\n\nWeekend maneuvers The diplomatic maneuvering began Saturday when European leaders met Zelenskyy in Kyiv and urged the Kremlin to agree to a full, unconditional 30-day ceasefire as a first step toward peace. Putin responded early Sunday by proposing direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul. Then came Zelenskyy's challenge to Putin for face-to-face talks.\n\nAfter days of silence, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov finally said Thursday that Putin had no plans to travel to Istanbul in the next few days.\n\nTrump said he was not surprised that Putin was a no-show. He had pressed for Putin and Zelenskyy to meet but brushed off the Kremlin leader’s decision not to attend.\n\n“I didn’t think it was possible for Putin to go if I’m not there,” Trump told reporters in Doha, Qatar, on the third day of his visit to the Middle East.\n\nTrump said a meeting between him and Putin was crucial to breaking the deadlock.\n\n“I don’t believe anything’s going to happen whether you like it or not, until (Putin) and I get together,” he said on Air Force One while traveling from Doha to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. “But we’re going to have to get it solved because too many people are dying.”\n\nPeskov said Putin has no plans to meet with Trump in the coming days.\n\nMedinsky, Putin's aide, is leading the Russian team that also includes three other senior officials, the Kremlin said. Putin also appointed four lower-level officials as “experts” for the talks in Istanbul.\n\nAlso absent from the talks were Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin’s foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov, both of whom represented Russia at talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia in March.\n\nThe top-level Ukrainian delegation included Umerov, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and the head of the Ukrainian presidential office, Andriy Yermak, a Ukrainian official said. Zelenskyy will sit at the negotiating table only with Putin, said presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak.\n\nPutin met Wednesday with senior government officials and members of the delegation in preparation for the talks, Peskov said. Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, General Staff chief Valery Gerasimov and National Security Council secretary Sergei Shoigu attended.\n\nRussia calls the talks a ‘restart’ The Kremlin billed the Istanbul talks as a “restart” of peace negotiations held there in 2022 that quickly collapsed. Moscow accused Ukraine and the West of wanting to continue fighting, while Kyiv said Russia’s demands amounted to an ultimatum, not something both sides could agree on. That delegation also was also headed by Medinsky.\n\nPutin's proposal came after more than three months of diplomacy kick-started by Trump, who promised during his campaign to end the war swiftly — although it's been hard to pull off . The Trump administration in recent weeks indicated it might walk away from the effort if there was no tangible progress soon.\n\nSybiha, the Ukrainian foreign minister, met with Rubio and Sen. Lindsey Graham on Wednesday night in Antalya.\n\nSybiha reaffirmed Ukraine’s support for Trump’s mediation efforts and thanked the U.S. for its continued involvement, urging Moscow to “reciprocate Ukraine’s constructive steps” toward peace. \"So far, it has not,” Sybiha said.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Sybiha also met with other European foreign ministers, including his French counterpart Jean-Noël Barrot, who in a post on X reiterated the call for a ceasefire and the threat of “massive sanctions” if Russia doesn't comply.\n\n“We’re in a very difficult spot right now, and we hope that we can find the steps forward that provide for the end of this war in a negotiated way and the prevention of any war in the future,\" Rubio said Thursday.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer accused Putin of “standing in the way of peace.”\n\n“There was only one country that started this conflict — that was Russia. That was Putin. There’s only one country now standing in the way of peace — that is Russia, that is Putin,” he said in a visit to Tirana, Albania.\n\nBarrot echoed that sentiment: “In front of Ukrainians, there is an empty chair, one that should have been occupied by Vladimir Putin,” he said. “Vladimir Putin is dragging his feet and in all evidence does not want to enter into these peace discussions.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Lorne Cook in Brussels; Illia Novikov and Samya Kullab in Kyiv, Ukraine; Dasha Litvinova in Tallinn, Estonia; Aamer Madhani in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; and Matthew Lee in Antalya, Turkey, contributed to this report."

The goal is to reinforce the slogan 'Trade, not aid,' as the cornerstone of U.S.-Africa relations.\n\nU.S. commitments include a $550 million loan for the Lobito rail corridor to counter China and Russia's growing influence in Africa, particularly in the mineral and trade sectors.

        "full_content": "Attention will be on Istanbul today, where many hope progress might be made in ending Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now in its third year, as delegations from both countries prepare for talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he would head to Istanbul at a moment’s notice if Russian President Vladimir Putin turns up. However, the list doesn’t include the Russian leader read more\n\nDelegations from Kyiv and Moscow are set to meet in Istanbul on Thursday for the first face-to-face discussion between the two sides since March 2022.\n\nThe Kremlin confirmed on Wednesday that a Russian team will be in Istanbul for possible direct peace talks with Ukraine. However, Vladimir Putin isn’t on the list of officials, indicating he will not be present for the meet.\n\nTalks have previously taken place in cities such as Moscow, Kyiv, Washington, and Riyadh, as well as across Europe. Now, attention is focused on Istanbul, where many hope progress might be made in ending Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now in its third year.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has suggested restarting direct peace negotiations with Ukraine in the Turkish city. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on him to meet in person in Turkey.\n\nZelenskyy said on Tuesday, “If Putin does not arrive and plays games, it is the final point that he does not want to end the war.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian president is expected to meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara. He said he would head to Istanbul at a moment’s notice if Putin turns up.\n\n“If Putin does not arrive and plays games, it is the final point [showing] that he does not want to end the war. Trump needs to believe that Putin actually lies,” he said.\n\nWhat can we expect from the talks? Could this meeting bring an end to the war? Which leaders will be there? We will also take a look at the situation on the ground as these talks unfold in Turkey.\n\nHow did the idea of talks began?\n\nOn Saturday, Zelenskyy hosted French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in a show of unity. They issued a coordinated call for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine starting Monday.\n\nThe plan has received backing from the European Union and U.S. President Donald Trump, who had promised during his campaign to swiftly end the war that is now in its fourth year. The leaders pledged tougher sanctions on Russia if Putin did not accept the proposal.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nIn remarks to the media early Sunday, however, Putin effectively rejected the offer and proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul instead “without preconditions.” He did not specify whether he envisioned the talks to involve Zelenskyy and himself personally, or with lower-level officials.\n\nZelenskyy responded by insisting on a ceasefire, saying he will travel to Turkey — and challenged Putin to do the same: “I will be waiting for Putin in (Turkey) on Thursday. Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses.”\n\nWho will be attending?\n\nPressed by reporters on who will represent Russia in Istanbul, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to say, stressing that Putin had outlined Russia’s position clearly enough.\n\nTrump’s administration initiated separate talks with Russia and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia in March. But since then, the administration has indicated it might withdraw from the process if no tangible progress is made. Trump said Monday he was optimistic about the talks — a sharp contrast to a contentious Oval Office meeting with Zelenskyy on Feb. 28.\n\nThere is “the potential for a good meeting” between Putin and Zelenskyy, Trump said in Washington. He added he was “thinking about flying over” after his visit to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates but later said Secretary of State Marco Rubio and others from the U.S. will go to Turkey for the talks.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nPodolyak on Tuesday told a YouTube broadcast by prominent Russian journalists in exile that the Ukrainian leader won’t be meeting any Russian officials in Istanbul other than Putin.\n\nHe added that “there are always people” in Zelenskyy’s entourage who can “conduct certain negotiations at corresponding levels” with the Russians but questioned the point of a lower-level meeting. “Undoubtedly, only Putin can make the decision to continue the war or stop the war,” he said.\n\nThe Ukrainian president is expected to meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara. AP\n\nZelenskyy said Tuesday he will meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the capital Ankara, and wait there. If the Russian leader chooses Istanbul for the meeting, Zelenskyy said, then he and Erdogan will travel there.\n\nIf Putin doesn’t show, European and U.S. leaders should follow through with additional sanctions against Russia, he added.\n\nWhat happened at the talks in Istanbul in 2022?\n\nThe Kremlin billed Thursday’s talks as a “restarting” of peace negotiations in Istanbul in 2022, early on in the war, that quickly fell apart. Moscow had blamed Ukraine and the West for their alleged desire to continue fighting, while Kyiv said Russia’s demands amounted to an ultimatum rather than something the sides could mutually agree on.\n\nZelenskyy has said the Russian delegation’s demands included Ukraine’s recognition of Russian control over the Donbas, an area in eastern Ukraine consisting of Donetsk and Luhansk regions; constitutional amendments to declare neutrality; a significant reduction of Ukraine’s armed forces; and the surrender of long-range weaponry. “There were never any negotiations; it was an ultimatum from a murderer,” he said in 2022.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nPutin accused Ukraine of derailing a peace deal that was basically agreed on and included clauses of Ukraine’s neutral and nonnuclear status and details on how much its army would be reduced. “The Kyiv authorities … just threw it all away. They turned it down,” Putin said in 2023.\n\nThe Kremlin has said repeatedly “the Istanbul agreements” could serve as a basis for further peace talks. After Moscow illegally annexed the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in September 2022, Russian authorities started saying that Kyiv should also recognise “the reality on the ground.”\n\nWhat are their demands to end the war?\n\nPutin last year demanded that Ukraine cede the four regions, which it still does not fully control. He also wants Kyiv to recognise the Crimean Peninsula, also illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014, as Russian; Ukraine also must renounce its bid to join NATO and drastically reduce its army. He also demanded that the West lift sanctions imposed on Moscow after the invasion.\n\nKyiv, in turn, refused to cede any land and wants robust security guarantees against future Russian aggression.\n\nTrump, who has engaged in a broad diplomatic effort to end the war since taking office, has said that Crimea, “will stay with Russia.” He has also said that Kyiv was unlikely to ever join Nato.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin in the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow. AP\n\nWhat’s happening on the battlefield?\n\nBoth sides are preparing a warm weather campaign on the battlefield, where a war of attrition has killed tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides along the roughly 1,000-kilometre (620-mile) front line.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said Russia is “quickly replenishing front-line units with new recruits to maintain the battlefield initiative.”\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nIn 2024 and more recently, Russian troops have made slow but steady gains in several sections along the front.\n\nPutin said in March that Russian troops have “gained steam” and “are holding strategic initiative all along the line of contact.” Zelenskyy warned that Russia was delaying talks in preparation for bigger offensives.\n\nLast month, Moscow’s forces also declared that they fully reclaimed chunks of Russia’s Kursk region bordering Ukraine that Kyiv’s forces seized in a surprise incursion in August 2024. Kyiv denied the claim, but it has been steadily losing ground there as Moscow, aided by North Korean soldiers, worked to push them out and leave Ukraine without a key negotiating chip.\n\nSeveral attempts to establish at least a partial ceasefire have been unsuccessful. Russia effectively rejected a 30-day unconditional truce; the Kremlin instead declared two short, unilateral ceasefires for holidays in the last two months –– one for 30 hours at Easter and another for 72 hours to coincide with Russia’s World War II Victory Day celebrations. In both cases, Kyiv and Moscow accused each other of failing to halt the fighting.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nRussia and Ukraine also pledged in March to observe a 30-day halt to attacking energy infrastructure that was brokered by the Trump administration. Both sides repeatedly accused each other of massive violations until the measure expired.\n\nWith inputs from AP"
