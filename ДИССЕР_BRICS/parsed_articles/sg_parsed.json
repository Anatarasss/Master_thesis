      "KUALA LUMPUR – Malaysia is still uncertain if its partnership with Brics – an alliance of emerging economies – will have any adverse impact on its trade relationship with the US, following President Donald Trump’s warning that any attempt by Brics member countries to replace the US dollar as a reserve currency will be met with 100 per cent tariffs.",
      "Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim told Parliament on Feb 4 that the Cabinet is preparing for all eventualities when it comes to any decision made by the Trump administration, due to geopolitical uncertainties.",
      "“We cannot make any hasty decisions.",
      "We are still unsure of its impact on the country.",
      "Therefore, we must prepare at the Cabinet level and at a few special committees for any eventuality.",
      "“Our involvement with Brics is still at an early stage,” said Datuk Seri Anwar.",
      "Brics, which originally consisted of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, has had discussions about establishing a new reserve currency.",
      "The group has expanded to include Indonesia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Malaysia is one of Brics’ nine partner countries, but is not a full-fledged member.",
      "During the 2024 Brics summit held in Russia in October which was also attended by the partner nations, the 10-member bloc had discussed the possibility of establishing a gold-backed currency as an alternative to the US dollar.",
      "On Jan 31, Mr Trump repeated his threat to Brics members of 100 per cent tariffs should they go down the de-dollarisation route.",
      "“We are going to require a commitment from these seemingly hostile Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty US Dollar or, they will face 100 per cent Tariffs,” Mr Trump said on his Truth Social social media platform in a statement similar to one he posted in November 2024.",
      "But the Kremlin brushed off the threat, saying there was no such plan.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Brics was not talking about setting up its own currency, but creating joint investment platforms for third countries.",
      "Responding to a question by Bagan MP Lim Guan Eng on the possibility of US tariffs affecting Malaysia, Mr Anwar said the government is still negotiating with the US, but Malaysia cannot adopt a wait-and-see approach.",
      "Instead of waiting for the impact of potential US trade tariffs, Prime Minister Anwar said Malaysia needs to continue diversifying its exports and not rely on a few trading partners.",
      "Malaysia will thus actively build trade relations with other countries, such as China, Russia and Brazil.",
      "“On our part, we must take proactive steps... to aggressively open a wider network of trading partners,” he said.",
      "Mr Anwar noted that the US market accounts for around 11 per cent of Malaysia’s exports.",
      "According to the World Bank, as at 2022, Malaysia’s exports to China made up nearly 14 per cent of its total exports.",
      "China is Malaysia’s second-largest trading partner after Singapore, followed by the US in third place, while Russia and Brazil are not major trading partners.",
      "Speaking to The Straits Times, senior economist Yeah Kim Leng said a 100 per cent tariff would substantially diminish the value and amount of Malaysia’s exports to the US, because the resulting higher prices of Malaysian goods would make them less competitive in the US market.",
      "Among the major Malaysian products bound for US shores are semiconductors, integrated circuit boards, machinery and mechanical appliances.",
      "“There is a risk that if we cannot find an alternative market, our semiconductor sector will be severely affected,” said Professor Yeah, who is a director of the Economic Studies Programme at Sunway University’s Jeffrey Cheah Institute on South-east Asia.",
      "“A critical strategy is for Malaysia to harness American manufacturing firms operating in the country and see if they can lobby or directly appeal to the Trump administration, as these chips are used for their own domestic consumption,” he told ST.",
      "It would be self-defeating for the US to impose tariffs on products made by American firms overseas for their own home market, the academic said.",
      "It would not be economical or practical for US tech giants such as Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, Hewlett-Packard and National Semiconductor Corp – which have been operating in Penang since the 1970s – to pack up and find a new base to operate from, he added.",
      "In any event, Prof Yeah said, Mr Trump’s warning to Brics could simply be a negotiating tool, seeing as how he recently agreed to hold off imposing 25 per cent tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days.",
      "“We will likely see Malaysia negotiating to avert the US from imposing such a drastic measure.",
      "More importantly, Malaysia is still not a full-fledged Brics member.",
      "“There could be room for Malaysia to perhaps delay entry to be a full member until there is greater clarity on Trump’s strategy in dealing with Brics nations,” he said.",

      "WASHINGTON - President-elect Donald Trump on Nov 30 threatened to impose a 100 per cent tariff on the Brics group of nations if they undercut the US dollar.",
      "“We require a commitment... that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty US Dollar or, they will face 100 percent Tariffs,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social website, referring to the grouping that includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and others.",
      "The statement comes after a Brics summit held in October in Kazan, Russia, where the countries discussed boosting non-dollar transactions and strengthening local currencies.",
      "The Brics group has expanded significantly since its inception in 2009, and now includes countries such as Iran, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Altogether, the Brics coalition accounts for a significant minority of the world’s economic output.",
      "At the Kazan summit in October, Moscow secured a joint declaration encouraging the “strengthening of correspondent banking networks within Brics and enabling settlements in local currencies in line with Brics Cross-Border Payments Initiative.” But at the end of the summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin indicated that little progress had been made on launching a possible competitor to the Belgium-based Swift financial messaging system.",
      "“As for Swift and any alternatives, we have not created and are not creating any alternatives,” Mr Putin told reporters at the end of the summit.",
      "He added: “As for a unified Brics currency, we are not considering that question at the moment.” Trump has vowed to pursue a protectionist agenda, threatening hefty tariffs on neighbours and rivals.",
      "If Brics countries continue with their plans, Trump warned, they “should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US Economy,” he wrote.",
      "“They can go find another ‘sucker!’ There is no chance that the BRICS will replace the US Dollar in International Trade, and any Country that tries should wave goodbye to America.” AFP Join ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.",

      "Datuk Seri Anwar separately said the country has already submitted an application to join Brics – a group of emerging economies led by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – of which Moscow is the current chair.",
      "“This potential membership holds substantial promise for both nations and underscores our commitment to fostering robust international collaboration,” said Mr Anwar in a Facebook post on July 28.",

      "SINGAPORE – Even though several South-east Asian countries have expressed interest in joining the Brics economic bloc, there is no substitute for Asean, said Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan.",
      "“I think there is no question the key game in town in our part of the world is Asean,” he said in a media interview on June 26 as he wrapped up a two-day visit to Thailand.",
      "There is no substitute for Asean as an organising unit, a production, investment or competitive zone, he said, noting the region has 680 million people, with a combined gross domestic product of around US$3.5 trillion (S$4.75 trillion) that can potentially double and quadruple in the next two to three decades.",
      "Earlier in June, Thailand and Malaysia revealed that they plan to join Brics, a group of emerging economies led by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa that is seen to be challenging the Western-led global order.",
      "Myanmar and Laos had previously declared interest in joining the bloc.",
      "Dr Balakrishnan highlighted that Asean has signed trade pacts with countries such as China, South Korea and Japan.",
      "Asean countries, too, have tie-ups such as the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement founded by Singapore, Chile and New Zealand, which South Korea has joined and Thailand has expressed interest in joining.",
      "The attempts of Asean countries to broaden markets and reach a wider audience do not hinder the overall growth of the bloc and bilateral economic relations, he said.",
      "“As long as these measures lead to greater openness, inclusiveness, a level playing field and make member states more attractive for investments and promote trade, we’re in support of all these exploratory moves,” he added.",
      "Within Asean, countries need to double down on integration and connectivity and boost investments in infrastructure to enhance competitiveness, he said.",
      "Dr Balakrishnan was in Thailand on an official visit from June 25 to 26 at the invitation of his Thai counterpart Maris Sangiampongsa.",
      "On June 26, he delivered the opening remarks at the coordinating meeting of the Thailand-Singapore Civil Service Exchange Programme.",
      "The programme, established in 1997 and now in its 14th edition, gathers civil servants from both countries to share ideas and experiences in areas such as health, leadership development and education.",
      "In his speech, Dr Balakrishnan said the global economic paradigm is under pressure in a fractured world with wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and maritime tensions in the Pacific and South China Sea.",
      "Given the current global situation, the old formulas for economic growth and collaboration will not be sufficient, he said.",
      "On the bilateral front, Singapore and Thailand will need to make common cause in the new world that is emerging, finding opportunities in areas like the digital space and sustainable economy, he said.",
      "The two countries will celebrate the 60th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral diplomatic relations in 2025.",
      "Referring to the SQ321 turbulence incident in May, where the Singapore Airlines flight made an emergency landing in Bangkok, Dr Balakrishnan said the way the Thais rendered assistance is yet another reflection of the depth of the two countries’ longstanding relationship and their ability to rely on each other.",
