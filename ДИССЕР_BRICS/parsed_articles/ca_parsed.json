      "Ragui El-Etreby, Assistant Minister for Multilateral International and Regional Economic Affairs of Egypt, UAE Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior and Reem bint Ebrahim Al Hashimy, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Gedion Timothewos, Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Indonesian Foreign Minister Sugiono, South African Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Ronald Lamola, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister on Economic Diplomacy, Seyed Rasoul Mohajer and Ambassador Dammu Ravi pose for a family picture, on the day of the BRICS Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on April 28.Pilar Olivares/Reuters Foreign ministers from the BRICS group of developing nations failed to agree on a joint communiqué on Tuesday, highlighting differences within the fast-growing diplomatic bloc, while the chair Brazil issued a statement condemning trade protectionism.",
      "In the statement, Brazil said the group’s foreign ministers expressed “serious concern at the prospect of a fragmented global economy and the weakening of multilateralism” at their gathering in Rio de Janeiro.",
      "The statement did not name the United States, which has taken a sharp protectionist shift under President Donald Trump, whose unilateral tariffs have raised concerns about a global economic slowdown.",
      "The failure to reach a joint declaration was unexpected, a diplomatic source said, adding that there was room to iron out differences before July, when BRICS leaders will gather in Rio.",
      "The expanded BRICS group, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa as well as new joiners Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Iran, faces daunting challenges from U.S. trade actions.",
      "“The ministers voiced serious concerns about the rise of unjustified unilateral protectionist measures inconsistent with WTO rules, including indiscriminate raising of reciprocal tariffs and non-tariff measures,” the statement said.",
      "The statement reflected a broad consensus among the 11 countries, although a person involved in the negotiations said China – affected by 145% levies in the trade war with the U.S. – had pushed for a harsher tone.",
      "“There was a consensus among all the countries, which is expressed in the declaration,” said Brazilian Foreign Relations Minister Mauro Vieira.",
      "Still, the final declaration was a “chair statement,” falling short of a joint statement as the countries could not reach an agreement on all issues.",
      "Egypt and Ethiopia refused to accept some of the language calling for reform of the United Nations, including its Security Council, a long-standing aspiration of Brazil, India and South Africa.",
      "That difference underscores the group’s new composition after new members that have competing views on some issues joined in 2024.",
      "The diplomatic source told Reuters that the new African members took issue with putting forward South Africa as a preferred BRICS candidate for a reformed Security Council.",
      "“The expansion has its costs.",
      "Of course we have to work more to reach a consensus.",
      "But, at the same time, an expanded group has more power, more resources, more space for co-operation,” said the source.",
      "Brazilian diplomats stressed the importance of a strong shared position on the central issue of “unjustified” trade barriers condemned in the declaration, which cited tariffs and non-tariff measures, such as the abuse of green policies for protectionist purposes.",
      "“The main thing for BRICS is to ensure that the multilateral trade system doesn’t fall apart completely,” a diplomat told Reuters.",

      "Brazil will chair the bloc of developing economies through 2025 and said it will focus on promoting global governance reform and cooperation among Global South countries, according to a statement from the federal government.",
      "BRICS was established in 2009 by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, with South Africa joining in 2010 as a counterbalance to the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations.",
      "Last year, the bloc expanded by adding Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Saudi Arabia has also been invited to join.",
      "Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Malaysia have formally applied for membership, and several other countries have expressed interest.",
      "Recently, the bloc welcomed Indonesia as one of its 11 members and Nigeria as a “partner country,” a designation introduced at the 2024 summit in Kazan.",
      "Brazil said the partner countries are also invited to participate in the summit and may attend other meetings if there is consensus among members.",
      "“We will make crucial decisions for development, cooperation, and improving the lives of all the inhabitants of these countries,” said Mauro Vieira, Brazil’s foreign minister.",
      "President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose 100% tariffs on BRICS nations if they act to undermine the U.S. dollar.",

      "Beyond the short-term volatility and uncertainty created by U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff machinations, it’s likely that the longer-term trend of the world splitting into two trading blocs is accelerating.",
      "Stripping away Trump’s bluster and often contradictory actions, the message seems to be fairly clear.",
      "Trump’s view of the world is that you are either with the United States or against it.",
      "That presents a dilemma for Africa’s mineral rich countries as they want to develop their resources to provide them with the maximum benefit, but they also want to stay largely neutral.",
      "But it’s increasingly likely that at some level African countries will have to decide whether they are more in the Trump camp, or whether they prefer to do business with the China-led BRICS group.",
      "There are risks and rewards under both scenarios, and the circumstances of each African country may cause to lean one way or another.",
      "Much of the debate at this weeks Investing in African Mining Conference in Cape Town has effectively been about the best path forward for Africa’s miners and governments.",
      "The continent is already a major producer of minerals, but it’s untapped reserves are the major prize in coming decades, especially if the energy transition accelerates.",
      "Africa is richly endowed, with an estimated 20% of global copper reserves, about the same for aluminum raw materials, 50% of manganese and cobalt, 90% of platinum group metals, 36% of chromium, as well as reserves of lithium, uranium, gold and rare earths.",
      "But developing its mineral resources has been often too challenging, given political instability and corruption, poor infrastructure, lack of capital and legal frameworks that make long-term investments hard to justify.",
      "However, the increasing appetite of the world for minerals, especially to enable the energy transition, is likely to set off a new scramble for Africa, this time Africans will have more say in how it unfolds.",
      "Finding the right partners is the challenge for African countries.",
      "On the one hand the Western world still offers deep capital reserves, sophisticated equity markets and investors and skills and experience in mining and engineering.",
      "But Trump is undermining these advantages with his tariffs and threats to withhold aid and other funding, as well as his habit of turning on traditional allies and flip-flopping policies.",
      "The main issue with Trump is his apparent transactional view of the world, in which there must always be a winner and a loser, and he always wants to be the winner.",
      "This means getting a mutually beneficial deal from the United States is going to be more difficult while Trump is in office.",
      "It was perhaps this frustration that boiled over in the remarks at the Investing in African Mining event, on Monday when South Africa’s Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe said Africa should withhold minerals from the United States if Trump cuts aid.",
      "“If they don’t give us money, let’s not give them minerals.",
      "We are not just beggars,” Mantashe told the conference, which is also known as Mining Indaba.",
      "“We cannot continue to debate these minerals based on the dictates of some developed nations as if we have no aspirations to accelerate Africa’s industrialisation and close the development deficit,” Mantashe said.",
      "These comments may be unwise in that they may serve to antagonize Trump, but they may also sharpen some thinking in the West on how best to get access to Africa’s minerals.",
      "Should Africa be looking more toward China and the rest of the BRICS nations, as the best option to unlock its mineral wealth?",
      "The experience here has been somewhat mixed.",
      "While China has been willing to develop mines in Africa, it tends to want to do it mainly using its own people and processes, and it wants to export raw ores and beneficiate them in China.",
      "This has limited the benefits to African countries, but there may be an option to use legislation to copy what Indonesia has done in forcing companies to commit to domestic downstream operations as part of access to raw materials.",

      "President Donald Trump on Thursday warned off BRICS member countries from replacing the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency by repeating a 100%-tariffs threat he had made weeks after winning the November presidential elections.",
      "“We are going to require a commitment from these seemingly hostile Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs,” Trump said on Truth Social in a statement nearly identical to one he posted on Nov. 30.",
      "At the time, Russia said that any U.S. attempt to compel countries to use the dollar would backfire.",
      "The BRICS grouping includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa and a few other countries that joined in the past couple of year.",
      "The grouping does not have a common currency, but long-running discussions on the subject have gained some momentum after the West imposed sanctions on Russia over the war in Ukraine.",
      "“There is no chance that BRICS will replace the U.S. Dollar in International Trade, or anywhere else, and any Country that tries should say hello to Tariffs, and goodbye to America!,” he said.",
      "Trump posted his warning to the BRICS as Canada and Mexico await for his decision to follow through on a pledge to impose 25% tariffs on the United States’ North American trading partner from Feb. 1.",
      "Trump wants to use tariffs as a tool to get Mexico and Canada to help stem the flow of illegal drugs into the United States, particularly the deadly opioid fentanyl, and also migrants crossing illegally into the U.S. Dollar dominance – the outsized role of the U.S. dollar in the world economy – has strengthened of late, thanks to the robust U.S. economy, tighter monetary policy and heightened geopolitical risks, even as economic fragmentation has boosted a push by BRICS countries to shift away from the dollar into other currencies.",
      "A study by the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center last year showed that the U.S. dollar remains the world’s primary reserve currency, and neither the euro nor the so-called BRICS countries have been able to reduce global reliance on the dollar.",
      "The acronym BRIC, which did not initially include South Africa, was coined in 2001 by then Goldman Sachs chief economist Jim O’Neill in a research paper that underlined the growth potential of Brazil, Russia, India and China.",
      "The bloc was founded as an informal club in 2009 to provide a platform for its members to challenge a world order dominated by the United States and its Western allies.",
      "South Africa was the first beneficiary of an expansion of the bloc in 2010 when the grouping became known as BRICS.",
      "The group added Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates in 2023, and Indonesia became member earlier this month.",

    "sentences": [
      "When Republicans nominated Donald Trump to be their presidential candidate over the summer, the party’s platform included a pledge to maintain the role of the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency.",
      "Since winning the election, Trump has indicated that he wants to deliver on that promise.",
      "Over the last week he warned that if the group of nations known as BRICS countries — which include Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — tried to create their own currency to rival the dollar, he would punish them with 100% tariffs and shut them out of U.S. markets.",
      "“There is no chance that the BRICS will replace the U.S. Dollar in International Trade, and any Country that tries should wave goodbye to America,” Trump wrote on social media.",
      "The warning was intended to preserve the dollar’s premier status, but economists and analysts suggested that it could have the opposite effect.",
      "Although it appears unlikely that the BRICS countries would be able to create their own currency, the aggressive use of tariffs and sanctions by the United States is the reason that other nations have increasingly been considering alternatives to the dollar.",
      "By making such threats, Trump could end up accelerating that trend.",
      "“Threatening retaliation against the unlikely creation of a BRICS currency only reinforces the rest of the world’s concerns about the U.S. willingness to wield dollar dominance as an economic and geopolitical weapon,” said Eswar Prasad, the former head of the International Monetary Fund’s China division.",
      "“This will intensify other countries’ attempts to diversify away from use of the dollar for international payments and for foreign exchange reserves.” The dollar has been the world’s dominant currency for about a century and has served as the world’s reserve currency since the end of World War II.",
      "It makes up the majority of foreign exchange reserves held in global central banks and is widely used in international transactions such as trade and loans.",
      "However, the dollar’s global clout has been diminishing in recent decades.",
      "A Brookings Institution report earlier this year showed that the dollar’s share of global reserves had declined to 59% this year from 70% in 2000.",
      "China and Russia, which have been among the biggest targets of U.S. tariffs and sanctions, have been increasingly shifting their holdings to gold and other currencies as they look to distance themselves from the American financial system.",
      "Because of the ubiquity of the dollar, the United States can effectively cut off a country like Russia from the global financial system, and in recent years it has shown a willingness to take such actions.",
      "Trump appears to view tariffs and sanctions as complementary tools, but excessive use of those punishments tends to steer other economies away from the dollar.",
      "In a 2019 interview with The New York Times, former Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin acknowledged that over “a long period of time” there was a risk that the rest of the world could shift away from the dollar as the reserve currency and that the United States must be responsible about how it wielded sanctions.",
      "Despite speculation about the dollar’s demise, currency experts see no immediate threats.",
      "China has been encouraging the use of yuan in international payments, Russia has been using its own payment messaging system to circumvent U.S. sanctions, and Brazil has called for the BRICS nations to develop a dollar alternative to finance trade among their economies.",
      "But ditching the dollar for something else will not be easy to accomplish.",
      "Economists at Capital Economics noted in a report this week that tension between China and India would make any economic union complicated.",
      "They also argued that it would be more cumbersome for exporters to convert a new BRICS currency that’s designed for trade only among those countries into their local currencies.",
      "“A BRICS currency wouldn’t solve any of the problems that make moving away from the dollar hard, and in some ways would make those problems worse,” they wrote.",
      "Considering those complications, it is not clear why Trump chose to raise concerns now about the possibility of a BRICS currency.",
      "The president-elect has for years given mixed messages about his views on the dollar.",
      "Although Trump likes the prestige of a strong dollar, he has argued that it makes it harder for American manufacturers to sell their products abroad to buyers that use weaker currencies.",
      "That’s because their money is worth so much less than the dollars that they need to make those purchases.",
      "“As your president, one would think that I would be thrilled with our very strong dollar,” Trump said in 2019, explaining that U.S. companies like Caterpillar and Boeing were struggling to compete.",
      "“I am not!” Possessing the world’s reserve currency is widely viewed as a privilege because it lowers borrowing costs for the U.S. government, reduces import costs for American consumers and gives the U.S. greater geopolitical influence through its ability to use sanctions.",
      "It also tends to require the U.S. to run trade deficits so that it can keep dollars circulating around the world to finance global trade.",
      "But if U.S. deficits become too deep, it could erode confidence in the dollar because of concerns about the nation’s ability to pay its bills.",
      "Analysts at Nomura recalled in a report last month that the dynamic, which was outlined by economist Robert Triffin in the late 1950s, is known as the Triffin Dilemma.",
      "Trump seems to believe that tariffs will be a solution to this problem, reducing the trade deficit while forcing other countries to keep using the dollar.",
      "In the short run, Trump’s trade agenda would most likely encourage other countries, such as China, to weaken their currencies relative to the dollar so that their exports are less expensive for overseas buyers.",
      "Longer term, such an approach could compel other countries to distance themselves from the dollar and trade in other currencies if the U.S. market become too difficult to access.",
      "“I don’t know how much Trump as president will try to follow through on all the things he has talked about nor to what extent his tariffs will be an effective tool in international relations,” said Jeffrey Frankel, an economist at the Harvard Kennedy School.",

      "Over the weekend, president-elect Donald Trump again threatened to use tariff warfare as his bargaining chip of choice, just days after targeting Mexico and Canada.",
      "This time, he floated the idea of imposing a potential 100-per-cent tariff on the BRICS countries if they push for the creation of an alternative BRICS currency or rally around a new international trading currency to replace the U.S. dollar.",
      "These threats reveal a deep concern within the Trump administration that the U.S. dollar’s dominance in global affairs is waning.",
      "And they are right to be worried.",
      "Since the end of the Second World War, the U.S. dollar has reigned supreme in international economic affairs.",
      "Its dominant reserve currency status emerged under the Bretton Woods system, where it became the world’s primary hard currency.",
      "This dominance only intensified after the collapse of Bretton Woods in 1973 and the shift to fiat currencies – those issued by the state but not backed by a commodity, such as gold or silver.",
      "Today, the U.S. dollar remains the cornerstone of global trade and finance, with around 60 per cent of all foreign currency reserves held in dollars.",
      "Remarkably, while the U.S. accounts for just 10 per cent of global exports, more than 50 per cent of global exports are invoiced in dollars.",
      "This arrangement has brought significant benefits to the United States.",
      "Foreign governments typically maintain their dollar holdings in safe U.S. assets, principally U.S. Treasuries, creating a steady stream of external demand for U.S. government debt.",
      "This demand has helped to allow the U.S. to sustain public debt levels around 100 per cent of GDP while continuing to borrow at relatively low interest rates.",
      "Today, roughly one-quarter of U.S. public debt is held by foreign residents.",
      "Economists refer to this advantage as an “exorbitant privilege,” and it’s a privilege no country would want to lose.",
      "However, recent developments could catalyze a shift away from the U.S. dollar.",
      "In 2022, U.S. sanctions on Russia effectively froze the Russian central bank’s U.S. dollar holdings, exposing the risks of relying on an undiversified portfolio of foreign reserves.",
      "Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva subsequently floated the idea of a new BRICS currency to mitigate this economic vulnerability.",
      "The creation of a BRICS currency, however, is highly unlikely.",
      "The member countries are too geographically dispersed, and their economies too unsynchronized, for such a project to succeed.",
      "Even the euro – adopted by economically integrated countries – has faced significant challenges as an incomplete monetary union without fiscal unity.",
      "Mr. Trump’s threats are less about the hypothetical BRICS currency and more about the growing momentum toward alternative trading currencies and the diversification of foreign reserves away from the U.S. dollar.",
      "Signs of this shift are already evident.",
      "First, the sharp rise in gold prices during 2024 has been driven primarily by central bank purchases, marking a strategic pivot back to gold and away from the dollar after decades of declining gold reserves.",
      "Second, Russia, which held 55 per cent of its reserves in U.S. dollars as recently as 2017, now conducts its international transactions in Chinese yuan.",
      "These developments give the U.S. reason to worry.",
      "Countries are clearly reassessing the vulnerabilities in their reserve portfolios and making adjustments.",
      "More importantly, these moves hint at China’s growing influence in the global economic system.",
      "Russia may be serving as a test bed for Beijing’s ambition to expand the role in international trade, signalling a broader effort to reshape the global financial landscape.",
      "The BRICS countries already account for roughly a quarter of global economic output and 20 per cent of global trade – numbers that continue to grow each year.",
      "If high-growth economies such as Brazil and India deepen their ties to the yuan’s sphere of influence, it could accelerate the shift away from the U.S. dollar.",
      "While the dollar’s reserve status won’t vanish overnight, Mr. Trump’s warnings reflect legitimate concerns about the future of the U.S. economic model, which is built on the dollar’s unparalleled status.",
      "Cracks are forming in the foundation, and if they continue to spread, the entire structure could be at risk of collapse.",

      "The collective West should accept that this conflict cannot be decided on the battlefield, and that it is paramount we eschew escalation in favour of negotiation.",

      "Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, there has been much talk about the so-called BRICS countries forming an alternative to the global economic order.",
      "Some fear, and some gloat, that the financial hegemony of the Western industrialized countries is coming to an end.",
      "They say the importance of the U.S. dollar and to some extent the euro, which have been dominant in international commerce, will be replaced by some alternative championed by the BRICS countries.",
      "Many self-described geopolitical and economic experts are certain of this, although they never seem to name exactly what currency will knock the dollar off its pedestal.",
      "But this sentiment of the imminent death of the U.S. dollar is premature.",
      "The BRICS are not only poor competition for the West, but they are also, in different and uniquely individual ways, economic accidents waiting to happen.",
      "The risk is not that they will usurp the West but that many will become so economically, and eventually, politically chaotic that they will destabilize the entire world.",
      "Investors need to ponder this when evaluating where their portfolios are invested.",
      "The term BRICS was coined in 2001 by Goldman Sachs economist Jim O’Neill, to refer to the grouping of Brazil, Russia, India and China.",
      "South Africa was added a few years later.",
      "Mr. O’Neill’s thesis was that by 2050, these countries would dominate the world economy.",
      "Many economic analysts and investment strategists, including myself, viewed this hypothesis with derision.",
      "We felt that making predictions about the world economy a half century in the future was ludicrous, that the U.S. economy was not going anywhere soon and the analysis showed an acute naivete about the BRICS as individual countries.",
      "Shortly after the term was coined, it quickly became a term of contempt.",
      "BRICS became associated with large countries with abundant resources that failed chronically to deliver economic prosperity to its citizens.",
      "Almost a quarter of a century after the term was created, only China has come close to living up to its potential.",
      "Still, despite its size, China remains a middle-income country.",
      "It faces numerous challenges and has never developed proper capital markets – a crucial factor in prosperity.",
      "Chinese stock markets have done very poorly, especially for an economy that was heralded as the the usurper to the dominant position of the United States.",
      "Arguably, India is the only BRICS country whose outlook appears better than it did in 2001.",
      "However, at a GDP per capita of about US$2,500, India remains a poor country.",
      "It is growing but has a long way to go.",
      "It also continues to have issues with Khalistani separatists and Islamists, both internally and on its borders.",
      "I remain cautiously optimistic about India, but its future is with the wealthy industrialized countries of the West and Asia and not the relatively poor BRICS countries.",
      "I believe the historic animus between India and China will eventually destroy this nascent alliance aimed at taking down the U.S.-dominated financial system.",
      "Brazil is a non-player.",
      "Although it may have had some potential, Brazil elected Luis Inácio Lula da Silva, a far-left anti-Western authoritarian and convicted money-launderer.",

      "Brazil will be fortunate if it a averts a serious economic crisis in the next few years.",

      "Russia is an interesting study.",
      "I believe that Russia is far less powerful and closer to an actual implosion than is generally understood.",
      "Total Russian GDP is lower than that of Canada, despite the country having almost four times the population, and that is using what is likely inflated Russian numbers.",
      "Russian two-year bonds are at over 20 per cent, although there is not a real market for them.",
      "That’s hardly indicative of an economic challenger to the U.S.",
      "Almost three years of war and economic sanctions have weakened an already anemic Russian economy.",

      "BRICS was formed to “promote independence from Western financial infrastructure and develop institutions such as the New Development Bank.” As outlined in Jeff Rubin’s 2024 book A Map of the New Normal: How Inflation, War, and Sanctions Will Change Your World Forever, it was Western sanctions of many countries that initiated this major shift in global power structure.",
      "Sanctions, like a wild snake, can flip around and bite the country imposing them, as do tariffs.",

      "Russia's President Vladimir Putin looks on during a meeting with Iran's conservative Parliament Speaker on the sidelines of a BRICS parliamentary forum in Saint Petersburg on July 11.VALERY SHARIFULIN/AFP/Getty Images Emerson Csorba is a business executive, previously working in geopolitics.",
      "The outcome of the American election underscores Canada’s economic and intellectual dependence on the U.S. market and the consequences of it.",
      "A renewed Trump administration has vowed an aggressively protectionist economic and trade policy, and that has been estimated by Toronto-Dominion Bank to lead to an approximately 2-per-cent drop in Canadian GDP.",
      "This is not a good position for Canada to be in.",
      "To get out of it, trade diversification targets must be met while Canada regains its traditional role as interlocutor among powers, both great and emerging.",
      "With this objective in mind, it is time for Canada to explore observer status in the BRICS, in which Canada would attend BRICS meetings and further multilateral relations with its members.",
      "The aim?",
      "To engage strategically with the many BRICS members positioned between the West and the Global East.",
      "In this way, we can better understand the aims of the latter, while walking a tightrope with the United States and other long-standing Western partners.",
      "This step will advance our interests and help us play our traditional role as reconciler in a more multipolar world requiring engagement with democracies and nondemocracies – as well as the many countries sitting in between.",
      "While uncomfortable to many, engagement with these BRICS members is paramount as the world becomes resolutely multipolar and dangerous.",
      "The idea behind membership in BRICS is that it is better to engage directly in this forum than to keep a distance, which almost surely promises increasing dependence on America and a negligible Canadian role in geopolitics.",
      "The BRICS was founded in 2009 by Brazil, Russia, India and China (South Africa joining shortly thereafter) to promote independence from Western financial infrastructure and develop institutions such as the New Development Bank.",
      "The BRICS has since grown, with the recent additions of Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Iran (Saudi Arabia has been invited and is considering acceptance, though attends meetings; Argentina was invited but has since declined).",
      "A recent Oct. 22-24 summit in Kazan, Russia, hosted by President Vladimir Putin, has led to the invitation of Kazakhstan, Turkey, Belarus, Cuba, Indonesia, Nigeria and Vietnam – a mixed bunch.",
      "As is evident in the current and prospective membership, there is little unity – the rivalry between China and India one such example.",
      "Many of the BRICS members walk a fine line between China and the West.",
      "Canada will soon need to walk this same line to develop new multilateral relations.",
      "The growing size and power of BRICS is undeniable.",
      "IMF figures indicate the expanded BRICS accounts for 46 per cent of the world’s population; the G7 just under 10 per cent.",
      "It is predicted that the BRICs will account for 37.6 per cent of world GDP at purchasing power parity in 2027, against 28.2 per cent for the G7.",
      "The disparity will grow – the G7 is aging while the BRICS’s populations are young and ambitious.",
      "Observer status in BRICS offers diversification of supply chains through partnership with select members, better access to investment – in turn creating new jobs for citizens – and potentially increased security through strategic balancing of Western and Global East relations.",
      "While benefitting economically, Canada can protect its interests by cultivating relations with a wider variety of partners.",
      "There is historical precedent in Canada’s strategic engagement with the USSR, China and Cuba as interlocutor for America during the Cold War.",
      "Canada can also engage further with platforms such as La Francophonie, connecting with rising powers in the Global South.",
      "The risks of engagement are many.",
      "Dialogue with China is challenging; talk to achieve mutual understanding is interpreted by China as weakness rather than strength.",
      "Canada’s relations with India are currently fraught.",
      "The Kazan Declaration proposed a range of financial instruments (such as BRICS Pay) designed to enable BRICS countries to undertake cross-border payments and evade any Western economic sanctions.",
      "A risk is that what was once a network of developing countries promoting their interests becomes an anti-West alternative to Western alliances.",
      "Engaging with these countries requires strength, resilience and strategy on the part of Canada’s politicians and diplomats.",
      "But these characteristics are not specific to BRICS; they are necessary in the world and time we inhabit, and are also needed with America.",
      "Canada cannot assume, as has been the case in the past, that America will serve as its protector.",
      "The first Trump presidency suggests hostility as much or more than friendship.",
      "If Canada is to play a meaningful role in the new North America, and globally as a reconciler, seeking observer status in BRICS as a step toward more unconventional alliances should be on the table.",

      "KAZAN, Russia (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin closed a summit of the BRICS bloc of developing economies on Thursday, praising its role as a counterbalance to what he called the West's “perverse methods.\"",
      "The three-day summit in the city of Kazan was attended by leaders or representatives of 36 countries, highlighting the failure of United States-led efforts to isolate Russia over its actions in Ukraine.",
      "The conflict came up repeatedly at the meeting, which saw the first visit to Russia from United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in more than two years and drew an angry reaction from Kyiv.",
      "Guterres called for “a just peace” in Ukraine, in line with the U.N. Charter, international law and General Assembly resolutions.",
      "He also urged an immediate end to the fighting in Gaza, Lebanon and Sudan.",
      "At a news conference Thursday night, Putin was asked about former U.S. President Donald Trump's promise to end the fighting in Ukraine.",
      "“What Mr. Trump said recently, what I heard, (is) he spoke about the desire to do everything to end the conflict in Ukraine,\" Putin said.",
      "\"It seems to me that he said it sincerely.",
      "We certainly welcome statements of this kind, no matter who makes them.” Putin also was asked about whether any North Korean troops were in Russia, which he neither confirmed nor denied.",
      "The U.S. said Wednesday that 3,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia and are training at several locations.",
      "“Images are a serious thing, if there are images, then they reflect something,\" he said when asked about satellite photos of troops.",
      "Putin noted that lawmakers in Moscow earlier in the day ratified a pact with North Korea on mutual military assistance as part of a “strategic partnership” with Pyongyang.",
      "“We have never doubted that the North Korean leadership takes our agreements seriously.",
      "What and how we will do within the framework of this article (of the agreement) is our business,” he said.",
      "The summit covered the deepening of financial cooperation, including the development of alternatives to Western-dominated payment systems, efforts to settle regional conflicts and expansion of the BRICS group of nations.",
      "The alliance that initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa when it was founded in 2009 has expanded to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.",
      "Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members, and several other countries have expressed interest in joining.",
      "The Kremlin touted the summit as “the largest foreign policy event ever held” by Russia.",
      "Speaking at what was dubbed the “BRICS Plus” session, which included countries that are considering joining the bloc, Putin accused the West of trying to stem the growing power of the Global South with “illegal unilateral sanctions, blatant protectionism, manipulation of currency and stock markets, and relentless foreign influence ostensibly promoting democracy, human rights, and the climate change agenda.” “Such perverse methods and approaches — to put it bluntly — lead to the emergence of new conflicts and the aggravation of old disagreements,” Putin said.",
      "“One example of this is Ukraine, which is being used to create critical threats to Russia’s security, while ignoring our vital interests, our just concerns, and the infringement of the rights of Russian-speaking people.” Russia has specifically pushed for the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network SWIFT and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners.",
      "In a joint declaration Wednesday, participants voiced concern about “the disruptive effect of unlawful unilateral coercive measures, including illegal sanctions” and reiterated their commitment to enhancing financial cooperation within BRICS.",
      "They noted the benefits of “faster, low-cost, more efficient, transparent, safe and inclusive cross-border payment instruments built upon the principle of minimizing trade barriers and non-discriminatory access.” China's President Xi Jinping has emphasized the bloc’s role in ensuring global security.",
      "Xi noted that China and Brazil have put forward a peace plan for Ukraine and sought to rally broader international support for it.",
      "Ukraine has rejected the proposal.",
      "“We should promote the de-escalation of the situation as soon as possible and pave the way for a political settlement,” Xi said.",
      "Putin and Xi had announced a “no-limits” partnership weeks before Russia sent troops into Ukraine in 2022.",
      "They already met twice earlier this year, in Beijing in May and at a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan in July.",
      "Russia’s cooperation with India also has flourished as New Delhi sees Moscow as a time-tested partner since the Cold War despite Russia’s close ties with India’s rival, China.",
      "While Western allies want New Delhi to be more active in persuading Moscow to end the fighting in Ukraine, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement.",
      "Addressing the BRICS Plus session, Guterres urged an immediate end to the fighting in Gaza, Lebanon, Ukraine and Sudan.",
      "“We need peace in Ukraine, a just peace in line with the U.N. Charter, international law and General Assembly resolutions,” he said.",
      "Russia's Kremlin-controlled media touted the summit as a massive policy coup that left the West fearing the loss of its global clout.",
      "State TV shows and news bulletins underscored that BRICS countries account for about half the world's population comprising the “global majority” and challenging Western “hegemony.” TV hosts elaborately quoted Western media reports saying that the summit highlighted the failure to isolate Moscow.",
      "“The West, the U.S., Washington, Brussels, London ended up isolating themselves,” said Yevgeny Popov, host of a popular political talk show on state channel Rossiya 1.",

      "The conflict came up repeatedly at the meeting, which saw the first visit to Russia from United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in more than two years and drew an angry reaction from Kyiv.",
      "Guterres called for “a just peace” in Ukraine, in line with the U.N. Charter, international law and General Assembly resolutions.",
      "He also urged an immediate end to the fighting in Gaza, Lebanon and Sudan.",
      "At a news conference Thursday night, Putin was asked about former U.S. President Donald Trump's promise to end the fighting in Ukraine.",
      "“What Mr. Trump said recently, what I heard, (is) he spoke about the desire to do everything to end the conflict in Ukraine,\" Putin said.",
      "\"It seems to me that he said it sincerely.",
      "We certainly welcome statements of this kind, no matter who makes them.” Putin also was asked about whether any North Korean troops were in Russia, which he neither confirmed nor denied.",
      "The U.S. said Wednesday that 3,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia and are training at several locations.",
      "“Images are a serious thing, if there are images, then they reflect something,\" he said when asked about satellite photos of troops.",
      "Putin noted that lawmakers in Moscow earlier in the day ratified a pact with North Korea on mutual military assistance as part of a “strategic partnership” with Pyongyang.",
      "“We have never doubted that the North Korean leadership takes our agreements seriously.",
      "What and how we will do within the framework of this article (of the agreement) is our business,” he said.",
      "The summit covered the deepening of financial cooperation, including the development of alternatives to Western-dominated payment systems, efforts to settle regional conflicts and expansion of the BRICS group of nations.",
      "The alliance that initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa when it was founded in 2009 has expanded to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.",
      "Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members, and several other countries have expressed interest in joining.",
      "The Kremlin touted the summit as “the largest foreign policy event ever held” by Russia.",
      "Speaking at what was dubbed the “BRICS Plus” session, which included countries that are considering joining the bloc, Putin accused the West of trying to stem the growing power of the Global South with “illegal unilateral sanctions, blatant protectionism, manipulation of currency and stock markets, and relentless foreign influence ostensibly promoting democracy, human rights, and the climate change agenda.” “Such perverse methods and approaches — to put it bluntly — lead to the emergence of new conflicts and the aggravation of old disagreements,” Putin said.",
      "“One example of this is Ukraine, which is being used to create critical threats to Russia’s security, while ignoring our vital interests, our just concerns, and the infringement of the rights of Russian-speaking people.” Russia has specifically pushed for the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network SWIFT and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners.",
      "In a joint declaration Wednesday, participants voiced concern about “the disruptive effect of unlawful unilateral coercive measures, including illegal sanctions” and reiterated their commitment to enhancing financial cooperation within BRICS.",
      "They noted the benefits of “faster, low-cost, more efficient, transparent, safe and inclusive cross-border payment instruments built upon the principle of minimizing trade barriers and non-discriminatory access.” China's President Xi Jinping has emphasized the bloc’s role in ensuring global security.",
      "Xi noted that China and Brazil have put forward a peace plan for Ukraine and sought to rally broader international support for it.",
      "Ukraine has rejected the proposal.",
      "“We should promote the de-escalation of the situation as soon as possible and pave the way for a political settlement,” Xi said.",
      "Putin and Xi had announced a “no-limits” partnership weeks before Russia sent troops into Ukraine in 2022.",
      "They already met twice earlier this year, in Beijing in May and at a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan in July.",
      "Russia’s cooperation with India also has flourished as New Delhi sees Moscow as a time-tested partner since the Cold War despite Russia’s close ties with India’s rival, China.",
      "While Western allies want New Delhi to be more active in persuading Moscow to end the fighting in Ukraine, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement.",
      "Addressing the BRICS Plus session, Guterres urged an immediate end to the fighting in Gaza, Lebanon, Ukraine and Sudan.",
      "“We need peace in Ukraine, a just peace in line with the U.N. Charter, international law and General Assembly resolutions,” he said.",
      "Russia's Kremlin-controlled media touted the summit as a massive policy coup that left the West fearing the loss of its global clout.",
      "State TV shows and news bulletins underscored that BRICS countries account for about half the world's population comprising the “global majority” and challenging Western “hegemony.” TV hosts elaborately quoted Western media reports saying that the summit highlighted the failure to isolate Moscow.",
      "“The West, the U.S., Washington, Brussels, London ended up isolating themselves,” said Yevgeny Popov, host of a popular political talk show on state channel Rossiya 1.",

      "Russian President Vladimir Putin enters a hall for meeting with Mauritania's president on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia on Oct. 24.MAXIM SHIPENKOV/AFP/Getty Images Surrounded by the leaders of the expanding group of countries known as BRICS, Vladimir Putin didn’t just look comfortable in declaring “a new world order,” he looked smug.",
      "The West – what Mr. Putin would call the old world order – considers the Russian President a tyrant and a war criminal.",
      "That didn’t matter this week in the central Russian city of Kazan, where Mr. Putin hosted the 16th summit of BRICS, which originally comprised Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa but expanded this year to include Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "The gathering was also attended by 26 other countries that were either observing or seeking membership, plus United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres.",
      "It has been a good week for Mr. Putin.",
      "In addition to hosting the BRICS summit, there were widespread reports that North Korea had sent thousands of troops to Russia for training ahead of an expected deployment to the front lines of the war in Ukraine.",
      "When Mr. Putin launched the full-scale invasion 2½ years ago, the United States and its allies imposed punishing sanctions and other measures on Russia.",
      "If the West’s strategies were working, Mr. Putin would be isolated and presiding over a crumbling economy; instead, he is gaining new allies as Russia’s economy looks set to grow by 3.6 per cent this year.",
      "Meanwhile, the war grinds on, with Russian troops slowly pushing Ukrainian forces backward along a 1,000-kilometre front line, laying waste to entire cities in the process.",
      "In Mr. Putin’s vision – which received full-throated backing from Iran, but less bombastic support from the other core leaders – BRICS is about “the global majority” breaking free from the rules-based international order that the West established and has presided over since the end of the Cold War.",
      "“All our countries share similar aspirations, values and a vision of a new democratic world order,” he said Thursday in his closing remarks to the summit.",
      "In a speech short on specifics, he said a new international system should be based on “the legitimate interests and sovereign choice of nations,” rather than the current framework, which saw tools such as sanctions used to “ostensibly promote democracy, human rights and the climate change agenda.” In Mr. Putin’s new order, great powers such as Russia would be able to use force against their neighbours without consequences.",
      "Nor would the decisions of leaders like him be subject to the judgment of institutions such as the International Criminal Court, which has issued a warrant for his arrest in connection with the alleged mass deportation of Ukrainian children.",
      "The summit’s final declaration criticized “the disruptive effect of unlawful unilateral coercive measures, including illegal sanctions, on the world economy.” Russia’s economic survival is owing in large part to the willingness of China and India to continue buying Russian oil despite Western sanctions targeting Russia’s energy industry.",
      "Indian imports of Russian crude have jumped ninefold since the start of the war in Ukraine, while Chinese imports are up by a third.",
      "(China is also the main market of Iranian oil sold via a series of black-market schemes in order to avoid U.S.-led sanctions.)",
      "“After the BRICS summit, even the Americans and the Baltic States will probably stop talking about Russia’s isolation in the world,” political analyst and occasional Kremlin adviser Sergei Markov wrote on his Telegram channel Thursday.",
      "“The large-scale and successful BRICS summit is a major diplomatic victory for Vladimir Putin.” Mr. Putin gave his speech flanked by the leaders of the world’s two most populous countries, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "Mr. Xi stands accused of running a network of detention camps in China’s northwestern Xinjiang region and of militarily threatening Taiwan, which Beijing claims as Chinese territory, while Mr. Modi’s India has allegedly ordered political assassinations in Canada and the U.S.",
      "But those issues weren’t discussed in Kazan.",
      "Instead, the BRICS summit was the forum for the first face-to-face talks between Mr. Xi and Mr. Modi in five years – two days after China and India reached a deal to jointly patrol their shared border in the Himalayas, bringing an apparent end to a dispute that sparked deadly fighting at the frontier in 2020.",
      "Both Mr. Xi and Mr. Modi issued statements afterward emphasizing the need for a “multipolar world” – language that refers to breaking away from the current international system dominated by the United States.",
      "The BRICS leaders also discussed ways to reduce their collective reliance on the U.S. dollar.",
      "Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi, in their own face-to-face meeting, would likely have discussed the reported movement of North Korean troops into Russia for training.",
      "Ukraine, South Korea and the U.S. have all warned that they expect the soldiers will soon be sent to join Mr. Putin’s war on Ukraine.",
      "Such a deployment would almost certainly require the approval of China, Pyongyang’s closest ally, though Lin Jian, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, said Thursday that Beijing was “not aware of this situation.” Speaking in Kazan, Mr. Xi called for diplomatic solutions to the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.",
      "While BRICS remains mostly a talking shop without a unified economic strategy or firm military links, the collective clout of its members was demonstrated by Mr. Guterres’s decision to travel to Kazan despite loud complaints from Ukraine, which argued the Secretary-General should not attend a meeting hosted by an accused war criminal.",
      "Mr. Guterres, however, pointed out that BRICS now represents nearly half the world’s population.",
      "He said he had a responsibility to try to find a diplomatic solution to the war in Ukraine, as well as to the expanding conflict pitting Israel against Iran and its proxies across the Middle East, including Hamas and Hezbollah.",
      "In addition to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan were also in Kazan on Thursday.",
      "Mr. Guterres told the summit that it would take the entire international community “working as one global family” to address the spreading wars.",
      "He called for immediate ceasefires in Gaza, Lebanon and Sudan and “a just peace” in Ukraine.",
      "The call for global unity didn’t seem to move his Russian host.",
      "“In families, unfortunately, there are often quarrels, scandals and division of property,” Mr. Putin said with a hint of a smile after Mr. Guterres finished speaking.",

      "A giant screen set on the facade of a sports and a concert hall in Moscow shows a picture of Russian President Vladimir Putin delivering a speech at the BRICS summit, on Oct. 24.NATALIA KOLESNIKOVA/AFP/Getty Images Russian President Vladimir Putin told BRICS leaders on Thursday that the Middle East was on the brink of a full-scale war after a sharp rise in tension between Israel and Iran, though the Kremlin chief also faced calls to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "The BRICS summit, attended by more than 20 leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkey’s Tayyip Erdogan, has shown the depth of Russia’s relations beyond the Western world.",
      "Much discussion at the summit in the Russian city of Kazan was dedicated to the war in Ukraine and the violence in the Middle East, though there were no sign that anything specific would be done to end either conflict.",
      "“The degree of confrontation between Israel and Iran has sharply increased.",
      "All this resembles a chain reaction and puts the entire Middle East on the brink of a full-scale war,” Putin, sitting beside Chinese President Xi Jinping, said.",
      "Xi, speaking after Putin, said that China wanted a political settlement in Ukraine, and suggested joint efforts by Beijing and Brasilia offered the best chance of peace.",
      "“We need to work for an early de-escalation of the situation and pave the way for a political settlement,” Xi said.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin met with multiple world leaders this week, including those from China, India, Turkey and Iran, as part of the Kremlin's efforts to counterbalance the Western-led world order.",
      "The Associated Press On the Middle East, Xi said that there should be a comprehensive ceasefire Gaza, a halt to the spread of war in Lebanon and a return to the two-state solution under which states for both Israel and Palestine would be established.",
      "Putin scores a BRICS win with Xi and Modi show of harmony after years of animosity Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian criticized international organizations, particularly the United Nations, for failing to end the conflict.",
      "“The flames of war continue to rage in the Gaza Strip and cities of Lebanon, and international institutions, particularly the U.N. Security Council as a driver of international peace and security, lack the necessary effectiveness to extinguish the fire of this crisis,” Pezeshkian told the BRICS.",
      "Putin said that unless Palestinians got their state, they would feel the burden of “historical injustice” and the region would remain in “an atmosphere of permanent crisis with inevitable relapses of large-scale violence.” BRICS leaders in their summit declaration called for the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable Palestinian state within the borders of 1967.",
      "Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas attended the summit.",
      "At one of the BRICS+ meetings on Thursday, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar sat in for Modi who also missed one of the group photographs.",

      "KAZAN, Russia (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin closed a summit of the BRICS bloc of developing economies on Thursday, praising its role as a counterbalance to what he called the West’s “perverse methods.” The three-day summit in the city of Kazan was attended by leaders or representatives of 36 countries, highlighting the failure of United States-led efforts to isolate Russia over its actions in Ukraine.",

      "NEW DELHI (AP) — India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met Wednesday on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Russia, in their first bilateral meeting in five years.",
      "The meeting came days after the two giant neighbors announced a border accord aimed at ending a four-year-old standoff involving tens of thousands of their soldiers in mountainous Ladakh, India’s foreign ministry said.",
      "Xi and Modi shook hands against a backdrop featuring their national flags, and both stressed the importance of handling their disputes.",
      "The Chinese leader said the two countries were at a crucial stage of development and “should carefully handle differences and disagreements and facilitate each other’s pursuit of development aspirations.” “It’s important for both sides to shoulder our international responsibilities, set an example for boosting the strength and unity of the developing countries, and contribute to promoting multi-polarization and democracy in international relations,” Xi said.",
      "“The two leaders affirmed that stable, predictable, and amicable bilateral relations between India and China, as two neighbors and the two largest nations on earth, will have a positive impact on regional and global peace and prosperity,” India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters after the meeting.",
      "India announced on Monday that the two countries agreed to a pact on the resumption of military patrols along their disputed border in the Himalayas after a standoff that began with a deadly clash in 2020.",
      "China confirmed the agreement a day later, saying the two sides had reached resolutions related to their border.",
      "“China will work with India to implement these resolutions properly,” Lin Jian, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said Tuesday.",

      "Chinese President Xi did not attend the G-20 summit of leading economies and developing countries, which India hosted in New Delhi last year.",
      "Ties between the two countries deteriorated in July 2020 after a military clash killed at least 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese.",
      "That turned into a long-running standoff in the rugged mountainous area, where each side has stationed tens of thousands of military personnel backed by artillery, tanks and fighter jets.",
      "Misri said the pact would lead to the “disengagement” of troops at the Line of Actual Control, the long Himalayan border shared by the two Asian giants.",
      "Misri did not specify whether it means the withdrawal of the tens of thousands of additional troops stationed by the two countries along their disputed border in the northern Ladakh region after their armies clashed in 2020.",
      "Both India and China have withdrawn troops from face-off sites on the northern and southern banks of Pangong Tso, Gogra and Galwan Valley, but they continued to maintain extra troops at Demchok and Depsang Plains.",
      "The two sides have deployed troops in the forward areas of Ladakh for a fifth consecutive winter in freezing temperatures.",

      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the BRICS summit, in Kazan, Russia, on Oct. 23.ALEXANDER ZEMLIANICHENKO/AFP/Getty Images Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi used a BRICS summit in Russia on Wednesday to showcase ambitions for a more harmonious relationship between the world’s two most populous countries after years of animosity.",
      "The meeting between Mr. Xi and Mr. Modi, who have not held formal talks for five years, was one highlight of a summit which President Vladimir Putin sought to use to show that the West had failed to isolate Russia over the Ukraine war.",
      "A final communique listed a number of projects aimed at facilitating trade between BRICS countries – including an alternative payment system to the dollar – but did not include details or timelines.",
      "Just two days after New Delhi announced that it had reached a deal with Beijing to resolve a four-year military stand-off on their disputed Himalayan frontier, Mr. Xi told Mr. Modi that they should enhance communication and co-operation and effectively manage differences.",
      "“It is in the fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples for China and India to correctly grasp the trend of history and the direction of development of their relations,” Mr. Xi said, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.",
      "In response, Mr. Modi told Mr. Xi that maintaining peace and stability on their frontier should be a priority, and that mutual trust, respect and sensitivity should be the basis of the relationship.",
      "“We welcome the agreement on the issues that had come up over the last four years,” Mr. Modi told Mr. Xi in comments that were aired on India’s state broadcaster Doordarshan.",
      "BRICS – an idea thought up inside Goldman Sachs two decades ago to describe the growing economic clout of China and other major emerging markets – is now a group that accounts for 45 per cent of the world’s population and 35 per cent of the global economy.",
      "The BRICS summit clashes with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meetings in Washington.",
      "Former Goldman economist Jim O’Neill, who coined the BRIC term in 2001, told Reuters that he had little optimism for the BRICS club as long as China and India remained so divided.",
      "“It seems to me basically to be a symbolic annual gathering where important emerging countries, particularly noisy ones like Russia, but also China, can basically get together and highlight how good it is to be part of something that doesn’t involve the U.S. and that global governance isn’t good enough,” Mr. O’Neill told Reuters.",
      "Mr. Putin, who dismisses Western claims that he is a war criminal for Russia’s actions in Ukraine, played host to more than 20 leaders at the summit in the city of Kazan on the banks of the Volga, including Tayyip Erdogan, who leads NATO member Turkey, and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.",
      "Mr. Modi told Mr. Putin in public that he wanted peace in Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Xi discussed the war in the Ukraine behind closed doors with the Kremlin chief, as did United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who has sought to mediate.",
      "The 43-page final communique from the summit ranged from geopolitics and narcotics to artificial intelligence and even the preservation of big cats, but lacked detail on some major issues.",
      "It mentioned Ukraine just once.",
      "“We note with appreciation relevant proposals of mediation and good offices, aimed at a peaceful resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy,” the Kazan declaration said.",
      "The toughest language was reserved for the Middle East, calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and denounced Israeli “attacks against humanitarian operations, facilities, personnel and distribution points.” On alternative payment systems, there was little detail, though BRICS leaders expressed an interest in developing them and ordered central bankers to report back under the next presidency.",
      "“The trend for the BRICS’s leading role in the global economy will only strengthen,” Mr. Putin said, citing population growth, urbanization, capital accumulation and productivity growth as key factors.",
      "China and India buy about 90 per cent of Russia’s oil – Moscow’s biggest foreign-currency earner.",
      "Russia is the world’s second-largest oil exporter.",
      "The leaders said they would seek to further develop BRICS’s institutional development, but gave little clarity on whether or not BRICS would be expanded.",
      "Mr. Putin said that more than 30 states had expressed interest in joining the group but that it was important to strike a balance in any expansion.",
      "“I will take the BRICS group seriously when I see signs that the two countries that really matter, China and India, actually really trying to agree on things, rather than effectively trying to confront each other all the time,” Mr. O’Neill said.",

      "For Russian President Vladimir Putin, the three-day meeting also offers a powerful way to demonstrate the failure of U.S.-led efforts to isolate Russia over its actions in Ukraine.",
      "Kremlin foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov called it “the largest foreign policy event ever held” by Russia, with 36 countries attending and more than 20 of them represented by heads of state.",

      "Mr. Putin, who will hold about 20 bilateral meetings on the sidelines, conferred with Mr. Xi, Mr. Modi and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday ahead of the summit’s opening.",

      "Welcoming Mr. Xi, Mr. Putin described the relations between Moscow and Beijing as “one of the main stabilizing factors on the world arena.” He vowed to “expand co-ordination on all multilateral forums for the sake of global stability and a fair world order.” “Amid tectonic transformations unseen for centuries, the international situation is undergoing serious changes and upheavals,” Mr. Xi said, hailing the “unprecedented character” of Russia-China ties.",
      "Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin also discussed the Ukraine crisis, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, although he gave no details about those talks.",
      "Russia’s co-operation with India has also flourished.",
      "New Delhi considers Moscow a time-tested partner since Cold War times despite Russia’s close ties with India’s main rival, China.",
      "Western allies want India to be more active in persuading Moscow to end the war in Ukraine, but Mr. Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement.",
      "On the eve of the summit, Mr. Modi thanked Mr. Putin for his “strong friendship” and praised growing co-operation and the evolution of BRICS but also said that India felt the conflict in Ukraine should be ended peacefully.",
      "“We have been in constant touch on the subject of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine,” Mr. Modi said.",
      "“We believe that problems should be resolved only through peaceful means.” Mr. Putin hailed what he described as a “privileged strategic partnership” between Russia and India.",
      "When asked by BRICS reporters about the prospects for peace, Mr. Putin said that Moscow would not trade away the four regions of eastern Ukraine that it says are now part of Russia and that Moscow wants its long-term security interests taken into account in Europe.",
      "Two Russian sources said that, while there was increasing talk in Moscow of a possible ceasefire agreement, there was nothing concrete yet – and that the world was awaiting the result of the Nov. 5 presidential election in the United States.",
      "Russia, which is advancing, controls about one-fifth of Ukraine, including Crimea, which it seized and unilaterally annexed in 2014, about 80 per cent of the Donbas – a coal-and-steel zone comprising the Donetsk and Luhansk regions – and more than 70 per cent of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.",
      "Mr. Putin said the West had now realized that Russia would be victorious, but that he was open to talks based on draft ceasefire agreements reached in Istanbul in April, 2022.",
      "During a meeting with Mr. Ramaphosa, the Russian President emphasized their shared striving for a “fair, multipolar global order” and specifically mentioned efforts by BRICS members to create a “new independent payment system.” On Thursday, Mr. Putin is also set to meet with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who will be making his first visit to Russia in more than two years.",
      "Mr. Guterres has repeatedly criticized Russia’s actions in Ukraine.",

      "But first: Spending on cybercrime recovery is soaring, and the changing the nature of pharmacies as a business.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a BRICS business forum in Moscow on Oct. 18, ahead of the summit.ALEXANDER ZEMLIANICHENKO/AFP/Getty Images The acronym comes from its earliest member – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – but the group is looking to grow.",
      "Today, BRICS countries represent about 45 per cent of the world’s population and 35 per cent of its GDP as measured on a purchasing power parity basis, if Saudi Arabia is included.",
      "Geoffrey York is The Globe’s Africa bureau chief and has been following the growth and goals of BRICS for many years.",
      "He took some time while travelling in Namibia to help us understand more about the BRICS summit, which takes place from Oct 22 to Oct. 24.",
      "In his words, here are the important things to know before the summit begins.",
      "1.",
      "The summit is symbolic of changes in the global balance of power.",
      "From 1994 to 2008, when I headed The Globe’s bureaus in Moscow and Beijing, I heard a constant refrain from Russian and Chinese idealogues about the need for a new “multipolar world.” This meant, essentially, that the West should be counterbalanced by equally important centres of power in Moscow and Beijing.",
      "Today this vision of a multipolar world is beginning to take shape, and BRICS is one of its main vehicles.",
      "Russia and China, the two biggest voices in BRICS, are taking advantage of a global shift that has seen Western power and prestige badly dented by the Gaza and Lebanon wars and by the West’s inability to resolve a wave of catastrophic conflicts in Sudan, Ukraine, Congo, West Africa and Ethiopia.",
      "As the West declines, many middle powers in the Global South are seeing BRICS as a kind of insurance policy to help them cultivate allies on all sides.",
      "2.",
      "For its members and its would-be members, BRICS is a way to weaken Western pressure tactics.",
      "The authoritarian leaders who dominate the BRICS club have always resented Western sanctions.",
      "Its latest membership expansion has brought in Iran, which is even more virulently opposed to sanctions because of its own status as a target of those measures.",
      "Dozens of other countries have applied to join the BRICS organization at the Russian-hosted summit this week, although they might first become “partners” rather than full members.",
      "By uniting against sanctions, and by taking specific steps – such as creating their own international payments systems to ensure that their banking transactions are sanctions-proof – the BRICS members can reduce the effectiveness of Western pressure tactics and ensure that the West is unable to isolate any of them.",
      "There is also talk that BRICS could create an alternative institution to compete with the Western-dominated International Monetary Fund (IMF), making it easier for indebted countries to obtain credit with fewer strings attached.",
      "3.",
      "Despite many shared interests, it would be a mistake to see BRICS as a homogenous organization.",
      "Several of the key BRICS countries – including Brazil, India, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates – are not nearly as hostile to the West as other members like Iran and Russia.",
      "While the BRICS members agree on some issues, there is certainly no coherent foreign policy among them.",
      "Much of the bloc’s global impact is from its symbolism, rather than from cohesive policy decisions.",
      "There are frequent claims by excited commentators that BRICS will create its own currency to replace the U.S. dollar in international transactions, but this is a highly implausible scenario.",
      "Instead, the organization will slowly chip away at the dollar’s dominance in global trade by encouraging more transactions to be conducted in the national currencies of its members.",
      "4.",
      "Many of the most important BRICS conversations will be private backroom discussions led by Russian officials.",
      "Moscow is expecting at least 24 countries to send their leaders to the BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia.",
      "The formal speeches and events, as usual, will be rather turgid.",
      "Russia’s real gains will be in face-to-face negotiations in the back corridors, where it can engage in transactional talks and quid-pro-quo dealmaking.",
      "Russia has mastered the art of lavish gift-giving and high-level flattery as diplomatic tools.",
      "For months, it has been inviting the cabinet ministers of BRICS countries to travel to Moscow for pre-summit talks and private lobbying.",
      "This is a sophisticated influence campaign that could net some useful new friends for President Vladimir Putin.",
      "5.",
      "A key country to watch at this summit is Turkey.",
      "In recent weeks, Turkey has become the first NATO member to confirm that it is seeking membership in BRICS.",
      "It is perhaps the strongest example of the new wave of middle powers that want to maintain connections in all the major camps: the West, the East, and the South.",
      "But if Turkey joins BRICS, even as a “partner” country without full membership, the move could pose a distinct risk to NATO, potentially weakening NATO’s southern flank.",
      "This, in turn, would be another step in the decline of the Western-dominated “unipolar” world that Moscow and Beijing have long been fighting against.",
      "Tomorrow at 1 p.m.",

      "To submit a question, fill out this form.",

      "When it’s sunny, we tend to be less risk averse.",

      "People walk at the venue of the BRICS summit, in Kazan, Russia, on Oct. 21.Maxim Shemetov/Reuters Russian President Vladimir Putin will be shaking hands this week with multiple world leaders, including China’s Xi Jinping, India’s Narendra Modi, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Iran’s Masoud Pezeshkian.",
      "They will all be in the Russian city of Kazan on Tuesday for a meeting of the BRICS bloc of developing economies, defying predictions that the war in Ukraine and an international arrest warrant against Putin would turn him into a pariah.",
      "The alliance, which aims to counterbalance the Western-led world order, initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa but started to rapidly expand this year.",
      "Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia joined in January; Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia formally applied, and a number of others expressed a desire to be members.",
      "Russian officials already see the meeting as a massive success.",
      "Putin’s foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said 36 countries confirmed participation, and more than 20 will send heads of state.",
      "Putin will hold around 20 bilateral meetings, Ushakov said, and the summit could turn into “the largest foreign policy event ever held” on Russian soil.",
      "On the sidelines of the summit, Putin also will meet Thursday with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Ushakov said.",
      "It will be the first visit to Russia in more than two years for Guterres, who has repeatedly criticized Russia’s war in Ukraine.",
      "Optics and deals for the Kremlin Analysts say the Kremlin wants the optics of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with its global allies amid continued tensions with the West, as well as the practicality of negotiating deals with them to shore up Russia’s economy and its war effort.",
      "For the other participants, it’s a chance to amplify their voices and narratives.",
      "“The beauty of BRICS is that it doesn’t put too many obligations on you,” said Alexander Gabuyev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.",
      "“There are not that many strings attached, really, to being part of BRICS.",
      "And at the same time, there might be interesting opportunities coming your way, including just having more face time with all of these leaders.” For Putin, the summit is important personally because it shows the failure of Western efforts to isolate him, Gabuyev said.",
      "The gathering will demonstrate at home and abroad that “Russia is really an important player that is leading this new group that will end the Western dominance – that’s his personal narrative,” he said.",
      "The Kremlin will be able to talk to major players like India and China about expanding trade and bypassing Western sanctions.",
      "India is an important market for Russian commodities, while China is where Moscow hopes to source dual-use and various military-related goods, Gabuyev said.",
      "Russia also wants more countries participating in a payment system project that would be an alternative to the global bank messaging network SWIFT, allowing Moscow to trade with partners without worrying about sanctions.",
      "“The Russian idea is that if you create a platform where there is China, Russia, India and Brazil and Saudi Arabia, many countries that are vital partners for the U.S., the U.S. will not be ready to go after this platform and sanction it,” Gabuyev said.",
      "Russia is also expected to sign a “comprehensive strategic partnership” treaty with Iran, bolstering the increasingly close ties between Moscow and Tehran.",
      "After the invasion of Ukraine, Iran provided Moscow with hundreds of drones and helped launch their production in Russia.",
      "The Iranian drone deliveries, which Moscow and Tehran have denied, have allowed for a constant barrage of long-range drone strikes at Ukraine’s infrastructure.",
      "Iran, in turn, wants sophisticated Russian weapons like long-range air defence systems and fighter jets to help fend off a possible attack by Israel.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to comment when asked whether the treaty will include mutual military assistance.",
      "For China, BRICS is among several international organizations – along with the security-focused Shanghai Cooperation Organization – through which it seeks to promote an alternative to the U.S.-led world order.",
      "Xi pushed for enlarging BRICS, and the Kazan summit will consolidate economic, technological and military ties in the expanded bloc, said Willy Lam, a senior China fellow at the Jamestown Foundation.",
      "Beijing and Moscow also want to see if a new international trading currency could “challenge so-called dollar hegemony,” Lam said.",
      "The summit will allow Xi and Putin to flaunt their close relationship.",
      "The two, who announced a “no-limits” partnership weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, already have met at least twice this year, in Beijing in May and at a SCO summit in Kazakhstan in July.",
      "Although they will continue to present a united front, experts are watching for subtle signs of Xi distancing himself from Putin over the war.",
      "“While Putin will want the China-Russia relationship to appear as good as ever, Xi may also want to signal to Western states and others that Beijing officially remains `neutral’ in Russia’s war in Ukraine and is not a formal ally of Moscow,” said Eva Seiwert, a foreign policy and security expert with the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin.",
      "“This will be crucial for conveying the image of China as a serious and legitimate peacemaker in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.” An expected Modi-Putin meeting could see some rebalancing of their ties.",
      "Western friends want India to be more active in persuading Moscow to end the war.",
      "Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement.",
      "New Delhi considers Moscow a time-tested partner from the Cold War, co-operating on defence, oil, nuclear energy, and space, despite Russia’s closer ties with India’s main rival, China.",
      "Their meeting will be the second in months.",
      "Modi visited Russia in July, saw President Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine in August and travelled to the U.S. to see President Joe Biden in September.",
      "“India can’t simply abandon Russia because of its deep defence ties, the question of the regional balance of power, and the logic of multi-alignment,” said Raja Mohan, a professor at the Institute of South Asian Studies in Singapore.",
      "“At the same time, it also builds and develops its relations with the U.S. and the West because that is where the logic of India’s major economic development and technological growth depends on partnership.” India and Brazil view BRICS primarily through an economic lens to promote a more equitable distribution of power in the international system, while “China and Russia see it more as a geopolitical forum,” said Chietigi Bajpayee, who studies South Asia at the Chatham House in London.",
      "India and Brazil also don’t want to be “pulled into China’s gravitational orbit,” said Theresa Fallon of the Center for Russia, Europe, Asia Studies.",
      "Another key participant is Turkey, which has applied to join the BRICS group.",
      "That comes at a time when the NATO member and European Union candidate is increasingly frustrated with the West.",
      "Turkey’s EU membership talks have stalled since 2016 due to disputes with Cyprus and concerns over human rights.",
      "Turkey’s relations with Washington have been strained over its removal from the F-35 fighter jet program after procuring a Russian missile defence system.",
      "Erdogan also has accused the U.S. and other Western allies of alleged “complicity” in Israel’s military actions in Gaza.",
      "Membership in BRICS would help Erdogan “strengthen his own hand” at a time when ties with the West are at a low, said Gonul Tol, director of the U.S.-based Middle East Institute’s Turkey program.",
      "Middle powers like Turkey “try to extract more from both camps by being in-between camps, by having one foot in each camp,” he said.",

      "Mr. Putin hopes to build up BRICS – which has expanded to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates as well as Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – as a powerful counterweight to the West in global politics and trade.",
      "The Kremlin leader is due to host a BRICS summit in the Russian city of Kazan on Oct. 22-24.",
      "“The countries in our association are essentially the drivers of global economic growth.",
      "In the foreseeable future, BRICS will generate the main increase in global GDP,” Mr. Putin told officials and businessmen at BRICS business forum in Moscow.",
      "“The economic growth of BRICS members will increasingly depend less on external influence or interference.",
      "This is essentially economic sovereignty,” Mr. Putin added.",

      "Russia wants other countries to work with it to overhaul the global financial system and end the dominance of the U.S. dollar.",

      "Mr. Putin cited some of the initiatives that Russia has previously outlined ahead of the summit, including a joint cross-border payments system and a reinsurance company.",
      "Mr. Putin said that group members were working on a SWIFT-like financial messaging system immune to Western sanctions and the use of national digital currencies in financing investment projects with high growth potential inside and outside BRICS.",
      "He stressed that Russia’s financial initiatives for the summit implied the extensive use of national currencies, while talk of creating a single currency for the BRICS grouping was “premature.” He called on the New Development Bank, the BRICS’ only functioning multilateral development institution, to invest in technology and infrastructure across the countries of the Global South.",
      "“As a development institution, the bank already serves as an alternative to many Western financial mechanisms, and we will naturally continue to develop it,” Mr. Putin said.",

      "The BRICS organization takes its name from an acronym for its earliest members: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.",
      "While it has no policy-making powers or financial system, the group is united by its opposition to Western sanctions and its efforts to reduce the dominance of the U.S. dollar in global trade.",
      "It is seeking an international payments system that would allow its members to bypass sanction measures.",
      "At its summit last year in Johannesburg, BRICS leaders invited six countries to join the group: Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, Argentina, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "(Argentina later withdrew its application and Saudi Arabia is still mulling whether to accept the invitation, although it participates in BRICS events.)",
      "Russia, which took the rotating leadership of BRICS this year, has used the organization to mobilize greater support from Asia, Africa and Latin America, countering the Western effort to isolate it on the global stage after it invaded Ukraine in 2022.",
      "The BRICS countries now represent about 45 per cent of the world’s population and 35 per cent of its GDP, as measured on a purchasing power parity basis, if Saudi Arabia is included.",
      "In an example of Russia’s strategy for exploiting the bloc, a steady parade of South African cabinet ministers has trekked to Moscow in recent weeks for a dizzying range of presummit events – including high-level meetings of BRICS ministers of energy, trade, communications and justice and even a fashion summit, leading to a 50-country agreement on a BRICS International Fashion Federation.",
      "Beijing, meanwhile, has announced that Chinese leader Xi Jinping will attend the BRICS summit, a significant gesture of support.",
      "It will be his second visit to Russia since the invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Moscow’s biggest political coup, however, was the announcement last month that Turkey is applying to join BRICS.",
      "The news was disclosed by Yuri Ushakov, a foreign policy aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin, although the Turkish government later confirmed that a “process is under way.” The announcement was a key development because of Turkey’s long-standing membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Western military alliance.",
      "It signalled that Turkey wanted a closer relationship with Russia and China to balance its links with Europe and North America.",
      "“One could well argue that a page has been turned in the transition toward a less Western world when the first NATO member, in this case Turkey, applied to join BRICS,” said Jorge Heine, an analyst at Boston University, in a recent commentary.",
      "Russia has sounded triumphant as it touts the growing geopolitical popularity of BRICS.",
      "Mr. Ushakov, in an interview with Russian news agency TASS, boasted that the bloc has achieved “growing authority and influence” and is “creating a new world order.” The West, he said, is “outspokenly jealous about its expansion, as well as about the fact that the countries of the global majority would like to unite more closely for co-operation on the BRICS platform.” Mr. Putin said in June that 34 countries have shown an interest in joining BRICS in one form or another.",
      "In addition to Turkey, they include countries such as Pakistan, Malaysia, Thailand, Nigeria, Cuba, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Venezuela, Bolivia, Syria, Kazakhstan and Bangladesh.",
      "Western leaders have tended to dismiss or ignore the rise of BRICS, but the group has gained momentum from an anti-Western backlash to the Gaza conflict and U.S. support for Israel, experts say.",
      "“Europeans and Americans should stop rolling their eyes and yawning when they hear the word BRICS,” said Asli Aydintasbas, a policy researcher at the European Council on Foreign Relations, in an analysis published on the institute’s website.",
      "The political agenda of the BRICS group is being “dominated by the authoritarian regimes,” she wrote.",
      "“On an ideological level, its members seem united in their belief that the West is steeped in hypocrisy, especially regarding Gaza, [and] has overstayed its welcome as the head of global power.” The BRICS partnership has made it easier for officially non-aligned countries such as South Africa to forge closer military links to Moscow.",
      "At a navy festival in South Africa this month, two Russian naval vessels – including an anti-submarine warfare frigate – were the only foreign ships to participate.",
      "The United States, meanwhile, was forced to withdraw from a major defence exhibition in Pretoria last month when South Africa failed to grant it a routine diplomatic privileges agreement.",

      "“It is obvious that in the new geopolitical realities, cooperation in the energy sector should serve to strengthen national economies, help solve priority social problems, and improve people’s quality of life,” Putin said in a letter to the forum’s participants and guests.",
      "“It is crucial to agree on common principles for our countries in the just energy transition, and outline ways to strengthen the role of BRICS in the global energy dialog,” he said about the forthcoming meeting of BRICS energy ministers.",

      "MOSCOW (AP) — Chinese leader Xi Jinping will visit Russia next month for a summit of the BRICS bloc of developing economies, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi confirmed Thursday, a move that comes as Moscow and Beijing seek to counter the West’s global influence.",
      "Xi’s visit to Russia will be his second since the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "China claims to take a neutral position in the conflict, but it has backed the Kremlin’s contentions that Russia’s action was provoked by the West, and it continues to supply key components needed by Moscow for weapons production.",
      "Wang Yi met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg Thursday and the two hailed ties between the two countries.",
      "The Chinese foreign minister said that Xi “happily accepted” Putin’s invite to attend the BRICS summit in the Russian city of Kazan in October.",
      "Putin, in turn, announced that the two will also sit down for a bilateral meeting in Kazan and discuss various aspects of the Russia-China relations, which “are developing quite successfully” and “in all directions.” Xi last visited Russia in March 2023 and Putin reciprocated with his own trip to China in Oct. that year.",
      "The two leaders have since also met in Beijing in May, where Putin took the first foreign trip of his fifth presidential term, and in Kazakhstan in July.",
      "After launching what the Kremlin insists on calling a “special military operation” in Ukraine, Russia has become increasingly dependent economically on China as Western sanctions cut its access to much of the international trading system.",
      "China’s increased trade with Russia, totaling $240 billion last year, has helped the country mitigate some of the worst blows from the sanctions.",
      "Moscow has diverted the bulk of its energy exports to China and relied on Chinese companies to import high-tech components for Russian military industries to circumvent Western sanctions.",
      "The two countries have also deepened their military ties in the last two years.",
      "The BRICS alliance was founded in 2006 by Brazil, Russia, India and China, with South Africa joining in 2010.",
      "It has recently undergone an expansion and now includes Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates.",

      "South Africa’s cabinet announced on Monday that it has chosen a state-owned Russian bank, Gazprombank, as the preferred investor to revive a mothballed refinery on its southern coast, in a deal reportedly worth about $265-million.",
      "Of the 20 bidders for the deal, 19 were disqualified on technicalities, paving the way for the Russian bank to win easily, according to South African media reports.",
      "The bank has been under U.S. sanctions because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but the BRICS partnerships have helped Moscow forge business deals that are beyond the reach of Western sanctions.",
      "The bloc was originally created by Brazil, Russia, India and China, known as the BRIC group.",
      "It expanded to include South Africa in 2010, and it expanded again this year by accepting membership requests from Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Argentina and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "The organization has been united by its opposition to the Western use of sanctions to punish certain countries.",
      "A South African cabinet minister, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, defended the refinery deal by citing her government’s promise to increase trade and investment within BRICS.",
      "Its relationship with Russia is “driven by our partnership in BRICS,” she told journalists on Monday.",
      "“There would be no point being in BRICS if South Africa did not partner with BRICS countries in trade and investment.",
      "It’s part of making sure that we build a resilient economy that is not susceptible to only one side of the global balance of powers.” South Africa held the rotating chair of BRICS this year, but Russia will be the chair next year.",
      "At a meeting of the bloc’s officials last week, a South African official handed a wooden gavel, designed in the colours of the Russian flag, to the deputy Russian foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, who declared that BRICS has advanced to “a level unseen and unpredicted.” He used the gavel to bang a traditional African drum, which he called a “symbol of the Global South.” South Africa has openly opposed Western sanctions on Russia.",
      "Late last year, one of its naval bases accepted a visit from a Russian cargo ship that was under U.S. sanctions, after a commercial port had refused to accept the ship.",
      "South Africa’s deputy minister of international relations, Alvin Botes, is visiting Moscow this week, and his agenda will include efforts at “deepening” the ties between the two countries, “especially in the area of economic co-operation,” according to a statement by the South African international relations department.",
      "In another potential windfall for Russia, the South African government is planning to unveil on Tuesday a new plan to purchase 2,500 megawatts of nuclear energy.",
      "The contract is widely expected to go to Russia’s nuclear agency, Rosatom, which had been on the verge of securing a major deal with South Africa under its then-president Jacob Zuma, until the deal was halted by a court challenge in 2017.",
      "Under the new refinery deal, Gazprombank will become the investment partner for a 45,000 barrel-a-day gas-to-liquids refinery at Mossel Bay, South Africa.",
      "The deal was recommended by South Africa’s state-owned oil company, PetroSA.",
      "The refinery has been closed for the past three years.",
      "But it is likely to play a key role in the development of a large South African gas project, following two huge offshore gas discoveries by TotalEnergies in 2019 and 2020.",
      "The refinery was first built in 1989 to help South Africa’s apartheid government bypass a United Nations oil embargo.",
      "A leading South African investigative journalism outlet, amaBhungane, reported last month that 19 of the 20 bidding companies were disqualified from the competition because of unusually strict technical criteria, including penalties for companies that were not majority-owned by an oil- or gas-producing state.",
      "The report said the PetroSA bid evaluation committee had raised concerns about Gazprombank because of the U.S. sanctions and the risk that South Africa could face secondary sanctions from the United States for doing business with a company under sanctions.",
      "But PetroSA obtained a second legal opinion, which concluded that the risk of sanctions was low, allowing it to go ahead with the Gazprombank deal.",
      "Kevin Mileham, an MP with the opposition Democratic Alliance, said last month that any deal with Gazprombank would be “a foolish move” that would damage South Africa’s relations with Washington.",
      "The deal could provoke U.S. lawmakers into a decision to expel South Africa from a preferential trade access agreement and could lead to sanctions against the country’s financial system, he said.",
