      "China, Brazil, and other Brics members denounced the “resurgence of trade protectionism” on Tuesday during a conference in Rio de Janeiro, overshadowed by US President Donald Trump’s tariff blitz.",
      "Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov were among the 11-country group’s senior diplomats who met for two days to discuss problems ranging from Trump’s trade war to the fight for peace in Ukraine.",
      "Mauro Vieira, the foreign minister of Brazil, which now holds the rotating Brics leadership, stated that the bloc emphasised its “firm rejection” of protectionism without directly alluding to Trump.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed a blanket 10% tax on dozens of nations, while China faces levies of up to 145% on numerous imports.",
      "Beijing has replied with 125% levies on US products.",
      "Brics, formed in 2009 by Brazil, Russia, India, and China and currently include Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates, has emerged as a key counterbalance to Western-led groups such as the G7.",
      "It currently accounts for about half of the world’s population and 39% of the global GDP.",
      "The meeting in Rio came at a critical moment for the world economy after the International Monetary Fund slashed growth forecasts over the impact of Trump’s sweeping levies on imports.",
      "The ministers did not issue a joint statement.",
      "Brazil instead settled for a declaration summarizing the discussions.",
      "Vieira said there was “absolute consensus” on the subject of “trade conflicts and tariffs.” DDD Some Brics members have avoided Trump’s trade fury.",
      "Brazilian exports to the United States are subject to 10 percent tariffs, a fraction of those imposed on China.",
      "And while Latin America’s biggest economy has been hit by Trump’s tariffs on steel imports – Brazil is the second-biggest supplier of steel to the US – President Luiz Inacio Lula’s government has declined to retaliate and sought to negotiate with Washington instead.",
      "Brazil has however made no secret of its frustration with European Union regulations on some of its agricultural exports, imposed over Amazon deforestation.",
      "Vieira hit out Tuesday at the use of “non-tariff” trade barriers, deployed under “environmental pretexts.” The group trod more carefully on the issue of non-dollar transactions among Brics members.",
      "At a summit last year in Russia, Brics leaders discussed boosting such transactions, eliciting a swift rebuke from Trump who threatened them with 100 percent tariffs if they undercut the US currency.",
      "Brazil said the ministers this week had “underlined the importance of greater use of local currencies.” Climate ambitions in jeopardy “Multilateralism” and “cooperation” were the watchwords of the meeting, which also discussed the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.",
      "The Brics ministers called for a “complete withdrawal” of Israeli forces from Gaza, terming Israel’s more than 50-day aid blockade of the territory “unacceptable.” They had less to say about the war in Ukraine, which is at a critical juncture, with Washington threatening to end its efforts to broker peace in the absence of a breakthrough.",
      "As in the past, Russia’s Brics partners stopped short of condemning Moscow’s invasion of its neighbor, while calling for a “lasting peace deal.” The growing global polarization is of particular concern to Brazil as it prepares to host the annual, often fractious UN climate conference in November in the Amazon.",
      "On Tuesday, Brazil warned that the international “fragmentation” was jeopardizing global “climate action ambitions.”"

      "Artificial intelligence (AI) can promote long-term economic growth in BRICS-Plus countries but may simultaneously increase poverty in the short term if governance frameworks are weak, a new international study has found.",
      "Published in the journal AI & Society, the study \"Artificial intelligence (AI)-poverty-economic growth nexus in selected BRICS-Plus countries: does the moderating role of governance matter?\"",
      "by Dr. Charles Shaaba Saba of the University of Johannesburg analyzed data from 2012 to 2023 across Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.",
      "Using econometric modeling, the research assessed whether AI investments contribute to higher GDP and reduced poverty, and whether governance quality influences these outcomes.",
      "The findings show that while AI adoption is statistically linked to increases in GDP per capita, it also correlates with rising poverty in countries with fragile institutions.",
      "The study warns that unless governance is strengthened, the benefits of AI could be unequally distributed, potentially worsening income inequality and social exclusion.",
      "The research found that a 1% increase in AI investment is associated with a 0.016% rise in GDP per capita among the BRICS nations.",
      "However, in the short term, AI adoption contributed to higher poverty rates, particularly in countries with weak labor markets or limited digital access.",
      "According to the study, AI’s economic efficiency gains can lead to job displacement and wage polarization in the early phases of deployment, effects that disproportionately impact lower-income households.",
      "The lack of adequate social safety nets or retraining programs can cause poverty levels to rise even as overall GDP increases.",
      "A key finding of the study is the moderating role of governance in the AI–poverty–growth nexus.",
      "Countries with stronger governance indicators, including regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption, were better able to translate AI-driven growth into poverty reduction.",
      "Using the Cross-Sectional Autoregressive Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL) model, the study showed that good governance amplifies AI’s positive effects on economic performance while minimizing its adverse social impacts.",
      "In contrast, poor governance appeared to neutralize AI’s growth potential and worsen inequality.",
      "The presence of weak institutions, political instability, or ineffective public sector management was correlated with rising poverty alongside increased AI deployment.",
      "While grouped as an emerging economies bloc, the five BRICS nations display divergent patterns in AI readiness and governance strength.",
      "China has made the most significant AI investments, while India has prioritized digital inclusion and innovation policy.",
      "Brazil and South Africa, despite democratic institutions, struggle with regulatory enforcement and infrastructure gaps.",
      "Russia’s governance profile, characterized by centralization and political risk, presented unique challenges.",
      "These variations influence how each country’s AI strategy plays out on the ground.",
      "In nations with stronger economic governance, including public financial management and regulatory frameworks, AI was more likely to support poverty alleviation.",
      "In others, technological advancements benefited elite sectors with limited trickle-down effects.",
      "The study also conducted panel causality tests, finding that economic growth leads to AI adoption, not vice versa.",
      "Additionally, AI was shown to influence governance quality over time, potentially by improving administrative efficiency and data-driven decision-making in the public sector.",
      "This bidirectional link reinforces the need for synchronized progress across institutional and technological domains.",
      "“Governments must invest not just in AI capacity, but in the rule of law, anti-corruption enforcement, and regulatory competence,” Saba said.",
      "The study calls for a dual-track approach to AI development: one that combines investment in technology with governance reform.",
      "Key recommendations include: Though focused on BRICS nations, the study’s conclusions have broader implications for the Global South.",
      "Many developing economies are turning to AI as part of digital transformation agendas, often without robust institutional checks.",
      "International bodies such as the UNDP and World Bank have highlighted governance as a prerequisite for ethical and equitable AI.",
      "The findings from this study reinforce that perspective, offering empirical evidence that AI’s promise hinges on the political systems around it.",

      "India’s advanced health systems may cushion the impact of the United States’ decision to exit the World Health Organization (WHO), but it may derail crucial initiatives in vulnerable regions, multiple public health experts told News18.",
      "The move was expected in 2020 as US President Donald Trump had already initiated steps to withdraw from WHO, citing the health agency’s biases towards China.",
      "However, it was subsequently reversed by new President Joe Biden in January 2021.",
      "According to Dr K Srinath Reddy, the US withdrawal is extremely “unfortunate\".",
      "“In an era where multilateral cooperation is essential for collectively addressing major global health challenges that arise from pandemic threats, climate change catalysed assaults on human health and antimicrobial resistance, USA’s withdrawal from WHO is extremely unfortunate,\" he said.",
      "Reddy believes that in an interconnected and interdependent world, it will have adverse consequences not only for other countries but also for the US.",
      "Another public health expert, Rajib Dasgupta, professor and chairperson, Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health, Jawaharlal Nehru University, believes that health agenda-setting is now global, as interconnectedness through travel, trade, and technology spreads health challenges across borders.",

      "“Agenda setting in health has increasingly become global and the connectedness of people across politico-administrative boundaries cannot be overemphasised.\"",
      "However, the move may not impact India harshly.",
      "Dr Anurag Agrawal, dean, biosciences and health research, Ashoka University, told News18 that the move does not mean much for India since “we are past the point where WHO support was essential for our health systems, but it may be a challenge elsewhere in the world where there is dependence on international support via WHO\".",
      "Trump has authorised a withdrawal from the WHO as well as a cessation of negotiations over a pandemic treaty.",

      "“For instance: What will be the impact on activities like global infectious disease surveillance networks?",
      "And is it time to go back to the drawing board over the negotiations of the pandemic treaty,\" she said.",
      "Ramakrishnan believes that the decision has serious implications for global health security, but the Covid-19 pandemic showed us that transparency and responsible science communication are also essential.",
      "The US exit may not impact India majorly, but it will definitely impact smaller and underdeveloped nations.",
      "The US contributes about 18-19 per cent of the funding to WHO.",
      "Therefore, its decision to pull out can lead to a financial crunch, which could adversely affect various health-related programmes.",
      "Reading the scenario, Dr Agrawal — who is also ex-director of CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology — believes that “unless the Trump administration creates a viable alternate path to support global health, this is effectively a decision that undercuts support for valuable programs in low income nations, at a time when we should have learnt that one cannot hide from global pandemic threats\".",
      "Meanwhile, as WHO will lose its top funder, other countries will need to step up their contributions and increase the level of scientific collaboration amongst themselves.",
      "“Both international cooperation and self-reliance will now acquire new purpose and fresh forms of functioning,\" Dr Reddy pointed out.",
      "These could include measures to control/treat HIV-AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases.",
      "Lack of funding could also result in halting some research projects.",
      "“The US pulling out of WHO may not be much of a negative to the US itself, however, it could have a major impact on African and Asian nations.",

      "US President Donald Trump, during his inauguration speech on Monday, announced the establishment of an external revenue service to collect tariffs from foreign countries exporting goods to America.",

      "Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,” Trump said.",
      "“For this purpose, we are establishing the external revenue service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues.",
      "It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our treasury, coming from foreign sources.",
      "The American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before, to restore competence and effectiveness to our federal government,” he added.",
      "This announcement follows Trump’s threat last month to impose 100 per cent tariffs on Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (the BRICS nations) if they create a new BRICS currency or back any other currency to replace the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency.",

      "However, unlike China, India’s trade relationship with the US is favourable, making the US a vital source of foreign exchange.",
      "Despite attempts to diversify its exports, India’s dependence on the US has grown over the past decade.",
      "According to official 2022–23 data, the US accounts for 18% of India’s exports, compared to 10% in 2010–11.",
      "India’s export basket to the US is well-diversified, benefiting industries ranging from textiles to electronics and engineering.",
      "During his first term, Trump invoked national security provisions to impose a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminium from India and other countries, breaking with the tradition of not targeting friendly nations.",

      "He said President Pedro Sanchez’s visit to India last year was a very successful one and his agreement with Modi that both countries should make a special effort to take their relationship forward.",
      "Jaishankar also announced that Spain will soon open a consulate in Bengaluru, calling it a “good sign” for deepening the relations between both the countries.",
      "He urged the diaspora to remain in touch with India and follow the debates and conversations happening in the country.",
      "“The biggest change I have seen in the last 10 years is the importance that the Government of India, the people of India have put on the contribution of diaspora,” he said.",
      "Jaishankar credited Modi for making Indians understand the invaluable contribution made by the diaspora.",

      "The deal first announced in 2005, saw New Delhi place all its civilian nuclear facilities under the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in exchange for a grant of exemption from the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which was formed following India’s nuclear weapon test in 1974.",

      "It was one of the few times that the Left and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came together in agreement.",
      "Formation of BRICS The BRICS grouping comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, first came together during Singh’s tenure as Prime Minister.",
      "The first meeting of foreign ministers of the BRIC (without South Africa), happened on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly in 2006.",
      "In 2009, the first BRIC Summit, attended by the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India and China, was held in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg, which saw the four leaders call for the reform of international financial institutions and a “more diversified” monetary system, which has slowly gained global momentum, with New Delhi consistently pushing for more trade in local currencies.",
      "In 2010, South Africa joined the grouping and in 2023, it further expanded to include Egypt, the UAE, Iran and Ethiopia, and has gained interest from a number of developing countries from around the world.",
      "One of the major outcomes of the grouping is the formation of the New Development Bank (NDB) as an institution for global development financing.",
      "Engagement with Pakistan During Singh’s tenure as Prime Minister, India witnessed a number of terrorist attacks stemming from across the border, including the 2008 Mumbai attacks, which left 166 people dead and more than 300 injured.",
      "However, Singh during his tenure reiterated that terrorism cannot impede on the peace process between India and Pakistan, meeting with Parvez Musharaff a number of times, including in the aftermath of the 2006 Mumbai train blasts.",
      "The most significant of meetings with his Pakistani counterparts was at the Egyptian resort town of Sharm El Sheikh in 2009, mere months after the 26/11 Mumbai attacks.",
      "The Joint Statement emanating from that meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani was widely criticised in India for its perceived delinking terrorism from the composite dialogue process, which found little support from his own party, the Congress.",
      "The statement also brought Balochistan into the picture, with Gilani making a mention “on threats” in the province, which Islamabad has long blamed New Delhi for fermenting.",
      "There has been little progress in ties between India and Pakistan in recent years, especially as the Modi government has maintained that terror and talks cannot go together under Quad 1.0 On 26 December 2004, two decades to the day of Singh’s passing, an earthquake off the coast of Aceh in Northern Sumatra led to a massive tsunami, which left close to 2,30,000 people dead across the Indian Ocean.",
      "In the aftermath of the tsunami, India, the US, Australia and Japan came together to form the ‘Tsunami Core Group’ to coordinate humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR)—the first coordination amongst a grouping of countries which later became the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.",
      "Under Shinzo Abe’s premiership between 2006 and 2007, Tokyo led the efforts to institutionalise the minilateral, which eventually petered out for a decade until it was relaunched in 2017 at the level of foreign ministers before being upgraded to a leaders’ level dialogue in 2021.",
      "HADR operations remain a key component of the current-day partnership between the Quad nations in the Indo-Pacific region.",
      "However, another result of Singh’s ties with Tokyo and Abe was the “Confluence of the Two Seas”, a speech by the late Japanese prime minister to the Indian Parliament in 2007, which laid the foundation for the understanding of the ‘Indo-Pacific’ region.",
      "WTO, G20, & the SCO Singh’s ten-years saw India’s international economic engagement increase substantially.",
      "In 2008 for example, India along with China was one of the major reasons why the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Doha Round talks in Geneva Switzerland were unsuccessful.",

      "Amid the recent maelstrom of political news was an important development for the future of technology-enabled public money.",
      "During the Brics Summit in Kazan, Russia, the Bank for International Settlements revealed that it was withdrawing from the digital-asset and payments initiative Project mBridge.",
      "Conceived in 2022 as a clearing-house for central-bank digital currencies (CBDCs), mBridge had anchored the BIS’s own work towards a global interbank settlement system to connect CBDCs beyond the control of any single government.",
      "Capitalizing on the efficiency gains of blockchain technology, mBridge offered an answer to all who are disenchanted with sluggish and unaffordable cross-border payments.",
      "As recently as June, the BIS had doubled down on the initiative, adding Saudi Arabia’s central bank to its roster of founding central banks and advancing it out of its pilot phase.",
      "Also read: Dedollarization drive: What would John Maynard Keynes have thought?Doubtless buffeted by the geopolitical headwinds coming out Kazan, BIS General Manager Agustín Carstens told a Group of 30 meeting in late October that, “we cannot directly support any project for the Brics because we cannot operate with countries that are subject to sanctions.\"",
      "Carstens’s comments reflect a growing tension in Western capitals.",
      "While many support efforts to use new technology to make the financial system more efficient and egalitarian, they don’t want to usher in a world order that is no longer grounded in Western law and norms.",
      "US intelligence agencies have long highlighted this trade-off when warning about rogue states that are building sanctions-proof alternative settlement mechanisms or using virtual assets to facilitate bilateral trade (such as between Russia and China).",
      "In Kazan, Brics leaders made no secret of their efforts to create a new financial order and jettison the dollar, thereby echoing long-standing Russian calls for a single blockchain-based Brics currency to fortify trade against Western sanctions.",
      "The uncomfortable question facing Western policymakers is whether their vision of a borderless digital economy enshrined in Western values is truly best served by a public-led model in which central banks take centre-stage and organize commerce at the supranational level.",
      "After all, a privately led, publicly refereed system has been the norm for the past 80 years.",
      "Also read: De-dollarization debate: Multilateralism can solve the world’s financial needsIt was intermediated private money that exported Western rules and norms, creating a financial bulwark beyond Nato members’ borders and hard-coding US sanctions and anti-money-laundering measures into global banking and trade.",
      "Banks and multinationals have carried dollars to almost every corner of the planet, simultaneously serving as envoys for the US currency and financial system.",
      "For decades, this system has stymied money launderers, state sponsors of terror, drug traffickers and other criminals, pushing them to find ever more creative methods of evasion.",
      "However, rogue actors’ rapid adoption of unregulated forms of digital money has invigorated discussions—among leaders of both Brics and Western countries—about overhauling the existing global financial architecture.",
      "It is no surprise that the Brics have been at the forefront of projects like mBridge, given its potential to upend the established Bretton Woods order.",
      "But rather than shying away from mBridge and successful pilots of new global trade and payments rails, Western leaders should consider how to make the most of them.",
      "Just as the old international financial rails served Western policy objectives, so can the new digital ones.",
      "With mBridge already demonstrating that blockchain technology can connect the global economy through internet-speed transactions, the only question now is how to strike the right balance between public and private involvement.",
      "The answer may be deceptively simple: The most promising alternative to the Brics vision is to keep the existing architecture, but modernize the rails that distribute the dollar, euro and pound.",
      "As matters stand, roughly 90% of foreign-exchange flows are still dollarized, but the Financial Stability Board’s latest assessment of cross-border payments stresses that the fragile, slow and expensive legacy fiat-currency system needs an upgrade.",
      "Also read: Mitigate the impact of global shocks on India’s financial sectorWith consumer cross-border payment costs rising, America’s not-so-secret weapon to address the system’s deficiencies and counter its adversaries’ ambitions is simply to embrace regulated digital dollars and allow the private sector to keep doing what it has been doing.",
      "Can Western policymakers match the enthusiasm of Brics leaders for digitization and take steps to regulate digital dollars?",
      "If so, one of their first steps should be to create a regulatory structure for digital private money in the form of dollar stablecoins, which already has bipartisan support in the US Senate and the House of Representatives.",
      "Codifying a US standard for the safe, sound and regulated use of digital dollars—whether publicly or privately issued—would be an authoritative response to those who want to highlight a trade-off between using dollars and participating in the digital economy.",
      "By contrast, ignoring the technological implications of mBridge and tokenization could result in a major strategic loss.",
      "The dollar is inching toward representing only a plurality, rather than a majority, of global settlements.To borrow Carstens’s own prescient words in 2022: “Let’s ensure that our financial system builds on the existing governance of money, serves the public interest and works cooperatively with the private sector.\"",

      "India's trade with BRICS countries may be poised for a take-off as officials work to extend customs-related privileges to trusted merchants from these nations, which would also fetch similar benefits to Indian exporters to those markets, two persons familiar with the matter said.",
      "While such a mutual recognition agreement (MRA) is already in place with Russia, the next one will be signed with South Africa, one of the two people said.",
      "“This is expected by the end of January 2025.",
      "Work has already started to sign a similar deal with Brazil,\" the person said on the condition of anonymity.",
      "This may be followed by negotiations for a similar pact with China, India's immediate neighbour and biggest trading partner.",
      "Once the agreements are signed, India would speed up customs clearances for so-called authorized economic operators (AEOs) from these countries, reduce inspection levels, allow deferred duty payments and quicker tax refunds for their partners in India who are not covered by India’s own AEO programme, and accept self-declaration on the origin of goods.",
      "The same benefits will be available to Indian merchants, customs brokers and logistics players involved in trade with the partner country.",
      "Queries emailed to the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), Union finance ministry and the Chinese embassy in New Delhi seeking comments for the story remained unanswered.",
      "Also read | India-China trade: An alarming $18 billion discrepancy Extending customs-related privileges is common in international trade to boost goods movement.",
      "The European Union operates an AEO scheme across all its member states.",

      "In certain countries, the scheme is known by a different name, for example, as Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) in the US.",
      "India's latest effort in this respect is essentially an integration of the AEO scheme with BRICS nations.",
      "Enhancing cooperation in trade and customs is the next logical step, explained Biswajit Dhar, distinguished professor at the Council for Social Development.",
      "The freeze in bilateral relations, which had spilled over to economic matters, has now been lifted at the political level, and overall, there could be a lot of cooperation between India and China, said Dhar.",
      "“It would also pave the way for the removal of uncertainties and a new beginning in economic ties between the two nations in 2025,\" said Dhar.",
      "India's traditionally strong petroleum, gems and jewellery exports fell steeply in the first half of this fiscal year, hurt by slow growth in developed countries, although pharmaceutical, electronics and engineering goods bucked the trend, commerce ministry data showed.",
      "India’s trade with BRICS nations expanded 8.3% annually to $215.3 billion in FY24, as per official data from the commerce ministry.",
      "A second person said the road is clear for negotiating a similar deal with China, a major trade partner and India’s largest source of imports.",
      "“However, work is yet to start.",
      "There are many factors to be taken into account,\" said the person.",
      "A deal with China could help Indian exporters as India has a huge trade deficit with the world's second-largest economy.",

      "This promises to reduce compliance burden, foster trust among trade partners, and solidify India's position as a trusted and interconnected trade hub within the BRICS bloc and internationally, said Agarwal.",
      "The recent border disengagement with China and the bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in October on the sidelines of the 16th BRICS Summit in Russia are seen as major milestones in bilateral ties, with both nations committing to work on shared development goals.",

      "Brics nations have no plans to weaken the US dollar, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said on Saturday (December 7).",
      "“The idea that Brics is aiming to undermine the dollar is misplaced.",
      "Our focus remains on strengthening financial cooperation, not competition,” Jaishankar stated, underscoring India’s position on the ongoing debate surrounding a proposed Brics payment system.",
      "Jaishankar’s comments, delivered during an event in Doha, comes days after US President-elect Donald Trump threatened 100 per cent tariffs on countries attempting to challenge the dollar’s dominance.",
      "Trump, on his Truth Social platform last week, accused the Brics bloc— which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa— of potentially supporting efforts to replace the US dollar.",
      "“We require a commitment… that they will neither create a new BRICS currency nor back any other currency to replace the mighty US dollar,” Trump warned, threatening tariffs if countries did not comply.",
      "At a recent Brics summit in Kazan, Russia proposed “BRICS Pay,” a payment system akin to SWIFT and India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI).",
      "The system aims to facilitate seamless cross-border payments in native currencies like the ruble, yuan, rupee, real, and rand.",
      "While China and Russia have shown strong interest, other members, including India, appear cautious.",
      "The differences among the Brics countries over BRICS Pay is now more evident than ever.",
      "Earlier this week, Russian officials, reacting to Trump’s virtual threats, had taken a stance that appeared somehwat different from India’s view expressed on Saturday.",
      "Moscow signalled that Brics would press forward with its plans for a settlement system to facilitate non-dollar transactions.",
      "Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Pankin said on Friday (December 6) that the group is working on this setup.",
      "“Of course, it will continue,” Pankin said, pointing out that the project focuses on practical solutions rather than an outright challenge to the dollar.",
      "Prior to that, on December 2, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that there is echoing a growing trend among countries seeking alternatives to the dollar in trade.",
      "“The dollar is beginning to lose its appeal as a reserve currency for a number of countries […] If the US uses force, as they say economic force, to compel countries to use the dollar it will further strengthen the trend of switching to national currencies (in international trade),” he said.",
      "India’s assertion that it has no interest in undermining the dollar aligns with its strategic goal of maintaining its ties with the United States, a critical partner in countering China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "Jaishankar’s comments suggest a deliberate effort to distance India from any perceived confrontation with Washington.",
      "Russia’s stance, on the other hand, reflects its strained relationship with the US and an eagerness to promote alternatives to the dollar amid ongoing sanctions.",

      "One of his trendiest and boldest declarations is the threat of imposing 100% tariffs on BRICS nations, including India, which continues to pursue a common BRICS currency to challenge the dominance of the US dollar.",
      "The notion of de-dollarisation, long discussed within BRICS, presents a significant geopolitical shift, and Trump’s aggressive response underscores the stakes.",
      "For India, the situation is complex.",
      "On the one hand, the USA has shown activity in reducing reliance on the US dollar in global trade.",
      "On the other, it faces a difficult reality – the United States is now India’s biggest trading partner, with bilateral trade exceeding $120 billion in FY24.",
      "This economic interdependence complicates India’s position as it weighs its preferences amid rising global tensions.",
      "Trump, known for his protectionist policies during his first presidency, is doubling down on his “America First\" rhetoric.",

      "This sharp warning comes after BRICS members met in Kazan, Russia, in October to explore alternatives to the dollar.",
      "While many member countries are frustrated by the US’s economic hegemony, a cohesive approach to implementing a common currency remains elusive.",
      "India, a key member of BRICS, has taken a cautious approach towards the bloc’s proposed currency.",
      "External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar recently emphasised the complexity of establishing a unified BRICS currency, citing the lack of fiscal, monetary, and political alignment among member states.",
      "“From time to time, people have raised that there needs to be a BRICS currency, but remember, for countries to have a common currency, you need a huge alignment of the very fundamentals of fiscal policies, economic policies, monetary policies, or even political policies,\" Jaishankar explained.",
      "India has legitimate reasons for hesitating.",
      "First, its economic growth trajectory and trade relationships do not necessitate a drastic pivot towards a BRICS currency.",
      "The US dollar plays an integral role in India’s trade and financial transactions, and the USA has been reluctant to jeopardise profitable trade agreements with the West by endorsing a currency viewed as a direct challenge to the dollar.",
      "Second, India remains wary of China’s influence within BRICS.",
      "A common BRICS currency could allow Beijing to further its geopolitical and economic ambitions, potentially at the cost of other member nations.",
      "New Delhi is particularly cautious about aligning too closely with policies that could deepen Chinese dominance in the bloc.",
      "India’s trade relationship with the US has grown significantly, encompassing crucial sectors such as pharmaceuticals, IT services, and textiles.",
      "A 100% tariff on Indian exports, as threatened by Trump, would dramatically increase costs for Indian companies and render their products less competitive in the US market.",
      "Such a move could disproportionately affect small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that rely on exports to the US, creating ripple effects throughout India’s economy.",
      "Moreover, higher tariffs could weaken India’s position as a global trade leader and slow down its export-driven growth.",
      "India has also been diversifying its export portfolio to reduce overdependence on any single market.",
      "However, the sheer scale of its economic partnership with the US makes it unlikely that India would risk alienating Washington over a BRICS currency initiative.",
      "Trump’s tariff threats signal a broader challenge to the global financial order.",
      "For BRICS nations, including India, the pursuit of a common currency reflects their frustration with the US’s dominance in the global financial system.",
      "Many emerging economies have long called for alternatives to the dollar, citing its outsized influence on global affairs and the risks of being overly exposed to US policies.",
      "However, the implementation of a BRICS currency is fraught with challenges.",
      "Economic disparities among BRICS nations, coupled with differing political priorities and governance structures, make a unified currency unlikely in the near term.",
      "Even within BRICS, there is little consensus on how to approach de-dollarisation.",
      "While Russia and China have pushed for increased use of their currencies in bilateral trade, other members, such as India, have opted for a more measured approach.",
      "This divergence highlights the inherent difficulties of aligning monetary approaches across diverse nations.",

      "C. Raja Mohan US President-elect Donald Trump’s recent threat to impose 100 per cent tariffs on imports from BRICS nations —if they create an alternative to the US dollar — highlights a powerful new impulse in Washington: Leveraging tariffs for various economic and political purposes.",
      "While defending the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency is one aspect, Trump and his team have broader ambitions to overhaul the global economic order using tariffs as their primary tool.",
      "Delhi must prepare for fundamental changes in the international trading and financial system in the second term of President Trump.",
      "The commerce ministry is reportedly reviewing India’s trade with the US and developing strategies to address the incoming Trump Administration’s economic policies.",
      "On BRICS and the discussion of “de-dollarisation”, Trump is making preemptive threats against a move that is yet to materialise.",
      "His trademark aggressive stance essentially tells the BRICS countries, “Don’t even think about it.” Sceptics have long maintained that BRICS’ rhetoric about de-dollarisation exceeds its actual financial capabilities and their commitment to collective action.",
      "The BRICS nations lack unity in their goal to reduce the dollar’s dominance in the global financial system.",
      "Although Delhi may echo Sino-Russian rhetoric about building a new global economic order, the realists in the government recognise its vital economic interests are tied to Washington.",
      "After all, the US remains India’s most important economic and technological partner.",
      "Delhi’s primary concern should not be Trump’s threats against a hypothetical BRICS currency, but rather his determination to reshape the global economic system.",
      "Despite its rhetoric, BRICS neither had nor is likely to gain the ability to restructure the global economic order.",
      "The US, however, possesses the financial clout to force major systemic changes — as demonstrated when Washington modified the nuclear nonproliferation order for India during 2005–08.",
      "Trump brings both longstanding conviction and strong political will to transform the international trading system.",
      "Though Trump entered politics only in 2016, he has consistently opposed free trade agreements that he believed undermined American economic interests while benefiting both allies and adversaries.",
      "He criticised Japan’s growing trade deficits in the 1980s, opposed NAFTA in the 1990s, and challenged China’s trade practices in the 2000s.",
      "During his first term (2017–21), Trump immediately withdrew from the Pacific Free Trade talks, renegotiated NAFTA, and imposed substantial tariffs on China, Canada, and the European Union.",
      "While reaching settlements with Europe and Canada, he maintained tariffs against China.",
      "President Joe Biden, after taking office in January 2021, continued these China tariffs, reflecting Washington’s new consensus on Beijing’s commercial challenges.",
      "Biden also maintained Trump’s policies that weakened the World Trade Organisation.",
      "Trump has successfully reoriented US trade policy and intends to pursue this direction vigorously in his second term.",
      "During his 2024 presidential campaign, he called tariffs the “most beautiful word” in English — after only “faith” and “love”— and pledged to impose 60 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports and 20 per cent on all others.",
      "His post-election cabinet appointments confirm his commitment to wielding tariffs as a powerful policy instrument.",
      "Scott Bessent, his Treasury Secretary nominee, recently outlined how tariffs can achieve various objectives beyond reducing trade deficits.",
      "Bessent argued, “Tariffs are also a useful tool for achieving the president’s foreign policy objectives.",
      "Whether it is getting allies to spend more on their own defence, opening foreign markets to US exports, securing cooperation on ending illegal immigration and interdicting fentanyl trafficking, or deterring military aggression, tariffs can play a central role.” According to Bessent, America’s position as the world’s largest importer — and thus the most crucial market for other countries’ exports — underlies this expansive use of tariffs.",
      "“Our size gives us market power and the ability to dictate terms.",
      "Other countries need us more than we need them.",
      "We have to but use that power.” This suggests that in Trump’s second term, the US might deploy tariffs like sanctions to influence both allies’ and adversaries’ policies.",
      "Bessent dismisses concerns that higher tariffs will fuel inflation and increase consumer costs.",
      "He maintains that strategic tariff use can boost treasury revenue, strengthen domestic production, and reduce dependence on industrial products from rivals like China.",
      "Drawing on Alexander Hamilton, America’s first Treasury Secretary and architect of its industrialisation, Bessent challenges conventional wisdom against using tariffs for economic or foreign policy goals.",
      "How might America’s trade partners respond?",
      "Europe, which maintains a substantial trade surplus with the US, and which Trump has called “more dangerous than China”, has discussed retaliatory tariffs.",
      "However, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has advised against retaliation, suggesting instead negotiations with Trump and increased US purchases to reduce the trade deficit.",
      "Trump recently threatened Mexico and Canada with 25 per cent tariffs unless they curbed cross-border drug and migrant flows.",
      "Notably, America’s two largest trading partners responded with offers to negotiate rather than confront the incoming US government.",
      "India, which had trouble resolving the trade disputes with the US during Trump’s first term, must reassess its commercial engagement with America.",
      "This requires understanding the transformed global trade landscape while emphasising reciprocity and mutual benefit in dealings with Trump.",
      "As External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar put it in his address to a business summit in Delhi on Monday, “A lot of what lies ahead would be in fashioning terms of engagement (with the US) that are perceived as mutually beneficial.",
      "And in that regard, the more that India can bring to the table, the stronger our appeal.” Delhi is acutely conscious that Trump’s trade policies combine negotiation with pressure.",
      "Bessent describes tariffs as Trump’s “loaded gun” on the negotiating table — a threat that might remain unused.",
      "Significantly, Bessent notes that Trump seeks to create a “fair-trade block” among allies and friends sharing common security interests and reciprocal tariff approaches.",
      "This is an objective with which India has no quarrel.",
      "With China as Trump’s primary tariff target, India must consider how to leverage this situation through creative trade policies toward America.",
      "Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s watch, there have been many significant advances in Indo-US relations over the last decade.",
      "Bilateral trade, despite its growing volumes, has been one exception.",
      "President Trump’s second term presents Delhi the challenge and opportunity to transform the trade relationship with the United States.",

      "US President-elect Donald Trump’s threat to levy 100 per cent duty on imports from Brics+ nations, if they chose to float an alternative global reserve currency to the US dollar, is premature and does not take into account ground realities.",
      "The dollar is still the most widely used currency in the world.",
      "Eighty eight per cent of foreign exchange transactions take place in the dollar, 58 per cent of foreign currency reserves are held in the dollar, and 54 per cent of exports are paid in dollars.",
      "The Brics+ group’s share of global merchandise exports stood at 23.3 per cent in 2023, which is still less than the G7’s share of 28.9 per cent.",
      "Nearly 65 per cent global corporate funding happens in the dollar.",
      "Though the attempt of Brics+ to launch a reserve currency as an alternative to the dollar is seen as the most serious threat to dollar hegemony after the launch of the Eurozone’s single currency in 1999, the dollar is unlikely to be dislodged from its prime position any time soon.",
      "The internal disagreements in Brics+ bloc are also likely to pose a serious challenge to the de-dollarisation project as no one, especially India, would like to subscribe to a China-led finance order.",
      "At the most, these countries could diversify trade settlements and reserves by promoting local currency and gold to avoid a situation that Russia landed in after its war against Ukraine."

      "Days after US President-elect Trump’s warning to BRICS against de-dollarisation, India’s Finance Ministry responds in Parliament The Union Finance Ministry provided a cautious and non-committal response to a question in Parliament regarding India’s stance on a potential joint currency for BRICS nations.",

      "“We require a commitment from these countries that they will neither create a new BRICS currency nor back any other currency to replace the mighty US dollar, or they will face 100 per cent tariffs and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US economy,” Trump had posted on Truth Social earlier this week.",

      "Russia urged members to take concrete steps toward establishing the “BRICS Bridge,” a proposed international payments system.",
      "This initiative was proposed as an alternative to the dollar-based trading system and a sanctions-resistant payments network—leveraging central bank-issued digital currencies backed by fiat currencies.",
