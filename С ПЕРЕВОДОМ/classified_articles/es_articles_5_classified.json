    "The journalist Inna Afinogenova, defined in the 'Washington Post' as ¬´Russia's greatest propagandist in Latin America, has joined his team under a halo of being a repentant of the Putin regime.",
    "In fact, her work as deputy director of Russia Today in Spanish, the Kremlin organ to spread her propaganda, ended up abruptly to the point that she was accused of \"gaining dollars to the CNN Miamiera.\"",
    "Afinogenova appeared in Spain, hired as a collaborator of Iglesias for his podcast in 'Public' and then for the Red Channel itself, which has just made the leap to television after 'Okupar' the hole that has left 7nn in Madrid.",
    "At the same time, RT was vetoed throughout the western world because it was an obvious channel of diffusion of prorruse bulos and she resigned.",
    "The order of factors in this case is not clear.",
    "¬´I am Inna Afinogenova, Russian journalist.",
    "After several years working for a public television in my country, I started a stage as an independent journalist, ‚Äùhe announced on his YouTube channel, where he worked so far.",
    "Nothing is ever independent, neither in his years hired by Russia nor later.",
    "Afinogenova, the false repentant that bug Catalan independentism Afinogenova went from denying the Russian invasion of Ukraine (\"January will arrive, then February and March, will end 2022 and surely in the media they will continue to read that the invasion is imminent (...) an imminence that never arrives, does not do so for ignorance, but because they have it perfectly calculated,\" he said in 2021) to be publicly positioned against Putin.",

    "She maintains that it is no longer that inna.",
    "Although Pablo Iglesias has rushed out in his defense, the precedents do not invite to think that he has changed a lot.",
    "Or worse: if you have done it, it is with dark intentions.",
    "\"My admiration for her and for her journalistic work is only comparable to the contempt that I feel towards that corporate mafia of Palmeros of power that today attack her with garbage,\" Churches attack.",
