    "- G7 finance chiefs condemned what they called Russia’s “continued brutal war” against Ukraine and said that if efforts to achieve a ceasefire failed, they would explore all possible options, including “further ramping up sanctions.” The description of the Ukraine war was watered down from the prior G7 statement issued in October, before Donald Trump’s re-election, calling it an “illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine.” Trump has diminished US support for Ukraine and has made statements suggesting that Kyiv was to blame for the conflict as he tries to coax Russia into peace talks.",

    "“There is a threat to us all from Russia,” Merz told reporters in Vilnius.",
    "- Russia has appointed a key commander of the gruelling siege of Mariupol, Gen Andrey Mordvichev, as head of the ground forces, the official newspaper of the Russian army reported on Thursday.",
    "Defence minister Andrey Belousov described the 49-year-old general as “an experienced combat officer who fully demonstrated his talent as a military commander during the special military operation,” using Moscow’s term for its Ukraine offensive, according to the Red Star newspaper.",
    "- Russia said it had shot down 159 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions, including about 20 headed towards Moscow, between 8 am and 8 pm on Thursday.",

    "The initial agreement with Ukraine is set to expire on 5 June, and both sides appear unable to reach an agreement before the deadline.",
    "- EU lawmakers meanwhile approved tariffs on fertiliser imports from Russia on Thursday, despite European farmers’ fears the move could send prices soaring.",
