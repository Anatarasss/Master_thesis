    "There are \"big egos involved\", he said before adding: \"This was a European situation, it should have remained a European situation.\"",
    "The US president also claimed he asked Mr Putin on their call: \"When are we going to end this bloodbath?\"",
    "He said of the Russian president: \"I do believe he wants to end [the war].\"",
    "\"My whole life is deals, one big deal, and if I thought that President Putin did not want to get this over with, I wouldn't even be talking about it because I'd just pull out,\" he added.",
    "The US president spoke to his Russian counterpart on Monday as part of a bid to push the two countries towards agreeing a truce in the war.",
    "In a Truth Social post, published shortly after the call, Mr Trump said Russia and Ukraine \"will immediately start negotiations towards a ceasefire and, more importantly, an end to the war\".",
    "Mr Trump continued: \"Russia wants to do large-scale trade with the United States when this catastrophic 'bloodbath' is over, and I agree.",

    "Discussions are 'positive,' says Zelenskyy The US president spoke separately to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and various European leaders.",
    "At a briefing after the day's calls had taken place, Ukraine's leader said he told Mr Trump that Russia \"might propose some particularly difficult conditions\" for a ceasefire - which could be \"a sign that it is the Russian side that is unwilling to end the war\".",
    "\"I think we are still discussing the very possibility of strong and severe sanctions [on Russia],\" he continued.",
    "\"I don't yet have an answer to that question.\"",
    "Kyiv is considering the possibility of a meeting between \"high-level\" teams from Ukraine, the US, Russia and some European countries, Mr Zelenskyy said, describing the talks on Monday as \"positive\".",
    "He continued: \"Such a meeting could take place in Turkey, the Vatican, or Switzerland.",
    "We are currently considering these three venues, as all three countries - all three venues - are neutral.\"",

    "The Russian president has resisted that, insisting that conditions be met first.",
