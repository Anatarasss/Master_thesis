    "Of course, this is a sweeping reason.",
    "These companies are not driven by human love.",
    "And to the extent that you want to distinguish between regime and population, it is clear by this time that Russians have no major problems with the war as long as they themselves are not called.",
    "Advertisement Advertisement Several companies also delay themselves for fear that their Russian assets will otherwise be confiscated by the Russian state.",
    "It is a realistic concern, but at the same time also the worst moral argument.",
    "If you make the decision to invest in an autocratic country, you have to stand.",
    "The fact that the development in such a country can quickly go to a legal situation for a company is not a strange thing.",
    "If you choose to invest in a country that is not a rule of law, you have made a conscious risk assessment.",

    "Is so foolish that you invest in China - or not withdraw now while time is - you have to blame yourself.",
    "Just German companies invest symptomatically with their government's eager approval in China.",
    "Symptomatic because the same government is sadly unwilling to assist Ukraine with military resources.",
    "In Ukrainian Kyiv Post, the Serbian security policy expert Dr. Orhan is drawn a review of how patiently Russia has spun a network of loyalty around the German establishment for several years: Advertisement Advertisement \"Berlin's Restraint Towards Ukraine is a Consequence of Russia's Long-Term Subversive Actions in Germanyâ€¦ .but this is also related to German Expectations that in some post-war arrangements, it will will be on again again.\"",
    "It is serious on several levels.",
    "If the EU's largest state consciously or does not signal that one would most like to see a return to normal relationships with Russia, why would Western business interests not impress on this and cling to their Russian positions so it goes?",
