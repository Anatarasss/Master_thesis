    "\"President Zelenskiy will not meet with any other Russian representative in Istanbul, except Putin,\" Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told Reuters.",
    "His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said Zelenskiy's trip to Turkey showed Kyiv was ready for talks but repeated Ukraine's stance that any negotiations must come after a ceasefire.",

    "Moscow has not said if Putin will travel to Turkey.",
    "\"We are committed to a serious search for ways of a long-term peaceful settlement,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday but would not comment further on the talks.",
    "Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, unleashing a war that has killed hundreds of thousands of soldiers on both sides.",
    "Most of Europe has rallied around Kyiv providing arms and financial aid, while Russia has turned to Iran and North Korea for support.",

    "Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, meanwhile, held talks with his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan.",
    "Reuters reported in 2024 that Putin was open to discussing a ceasefire with Trump, but Moscow ruled out making any major territorial concessions and insists Kyiv abandon ambitions to join NATO.",
    "Ukraine has said it is ready for talks but a ceasefire is needed first, a position supported by its European allies.",
    "Ukraine and its European allies have told Russia that it would have to accept an unconditional 30-day ceasefire from Monday or face new sanctions.",
